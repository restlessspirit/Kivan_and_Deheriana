@0    = ~I'm...I'm glad that we didn't have to kill these poor gnomes.~
@1    = ~Yes, but I pray that this will not lead to more deaths.~
@2    = ~Why do you say that?~
@3    = ~We were sent to teach them a lesson of fear and obedience. Instead, we have shown them that drow can be merciful. A dangerous lesson indeed.~
@4    = ~Oh... because we were disguised as drow. But maybe... maybe it's not bad.~
@5    = ~What are you saying, Aerie? As soon as svirfneblin relax their guard around the drow, they are as good as dead.~
@6    = ~I was just thinking. Everyone expects drow to be cruel, but some... some of them are not evil of heart. S-Solaufein, for example. So... so if someone looks upon such a person expecting mercy, not death, maybe he would be merciful.~
@7    = ~Promise me one thing, Aerie.~
@8    = ~Yes, Kivan, what is it?~
@9    = ~If a drow approaches you, his blade drawn, you will attack him with the deadliest spells you know.~
@10   = ~Even... even someone like Solaufein?~
@11   = ~Even him. For he might well kill you, if not from malice, then to keep suspicions away from himself.~
@12   = ~What is this stench? What is this... substance you are brewing, in complete disregard for my rest? Did you finally decide to replace the rotten mash in your head that <CHARNAME>, in a fit of unsightly altruism has taken for a sentient creature's brain, with something not quite so disgusting?~
@13   = ~This is glue, Edwin, made of fish bones and resin. I need to fletch some arrows.~
@14   = ~I see. One should expect, I suppose, that when people of inferior capabilities attempt to replicate the most meager of spells such as magic missiles, they end up producing nothing but a miasma.~
@15   = ~A spell could only be used once or thrice a day, while my arrows have no such limitation.~
@16   = ~Have not we bought enough of this feathered kindling to plant a small field with them already? (Now, I would not be surprised if he actually did plant them in hopes of harvest. These nature types are exhaustingly incompetent in their naiveté.)~
@17   = ~I trust my own workmanship best.~
@18   = ~Oh? How queer. But perhaps if I had to depend on such imperfect weaponry instead of my mighty spell craft, I would do the same. Luckily, my powers are great indeed, and I do not have to lower myself to peasants' handiwork. (Or should I call it folk-art?)~
@19   = ~Peasants'?~
@20   = ~Judging by its stench. Plebes ever gravitate toward the occupations that have maximum potential to sustain the emission of foul aromas. The more widespread a miasma is, the more content they appear with the results of their daily labors. As do you, apparently. Away with you! (Edwin presses a perfumed handkerchief to his nose.)~
@21   = ~What is it now?!~
@22   = ~Edwin, why won't you put a cloak over yourself while your robes are drying?~
@23   = ~Because, ape, I am too well-born and too gently raised to dress myself in rags that <CHARNAME> picked up from someone's dead warty back or bought from dirty merchants. My proper robes are what I am going to wear next to my skin.~
@24   = ~Then perhaps you should move it closer to the fire for it to dry faster.~
@25   = ~And risk ruining the fabric? (I am already suffering a blow to my reputation by being seen in such lowbrow company; must I also go around in burned garments?)~
@26   = ~I would much prefer that you cover yourself.~
@27   = ~Your kin do not scruple at much more overt indecency. Now, do stop quaking, I would like to think for a moment, before the next proud owner of a walnut-sized brain dares to grace me with the mewling it considers a conversation.~
@28   = ~I would hate for you to catch cold. The thought of you sneezing while wearing your new nose ornament is quite disturbing.~
@29   = ~Whatever it is that you should behold in this highly unlikely case (for surely, my hot blood will prove more than adequate protection from any base ailment) will be infinitely more important than anything you have said or have yet to say in your entire life. (Now, is that not disturbing?)~
@30   = ~Tell me, did your barbaric outfit just wag its tail in fond memory of the very recent past, when it roamed the forest on some other creature's back, or did you find a soul mate in a hazelnut thicket?~
@31   = ~It is a weasel, Edwin. Curiosity makes them near fearless, and I suspect that it views me as a provider of a life-long supply of cheese. Unfortunately, I will have to disappoint the little opportunist. He needs to hunt for himself.~
@32   = ~Yes, yes, feeding this...weasel is just as wasteful as feeding you; why I see even more similarities-a skinny sneak and bothersome besides. Perhaps if <CHARNAME> kept the rodent and dismissed you, we could at least save a bit on the cost of food, since we already have to resign ourselves to it going to no good use.~
@33   = ~Strangely enough, the creature tagging after me in hopes of catching a crumb or two from my meal reminded me of you, Edwin. Oh, every step of the way you try to make it as obvious as possible that you have fallen in with us ruffians by some ill chance, but the truth is that you need <CHARNAME>'s protection.~
@34   = ~My, my... you must be truly fond of me to compare me so generously to your newfound weasel-friend.  This shows that you should not presume to understand the motives of someone more complex than an overfriendly, demented rodent, let alone someone as sophisticated and cultured as a Red Wizard of Thay. You shall only hurt yourself.~
@35   = ~Lo, shaggy one, you have brute strength that I hate seeing go to waste. Carry one of these golems - I fancy writing a critique on the inferiorities of the technique used when these abominations where constructed.~
@36   = ~Carry it yourself if you need it.~
@37   = ~Ah, you have failed to understand once again the balance of powers and distribution of tasks: I am a highly intelligent man (though, in truth, I am doubtlessly more than a mere mortal man, but silence for now), and you are a muscular entity... of sorts.~
@38   = ~(Though I much preferred the Rashemi mountain-come-to-the-hamster.)~
@39   = ~So, when I tell to do something, you do it. Nice and simple, yes?~
@40   = ~For a wizard, you have wide enough shoulders. Burden them - it might do you some good.~
@41   = ~I could not shame myself by being seen in public carrying this tasteless piece of hedge wizardry. Why, someone might spread rumors that Edwin Odesseiron made such a thing.~
@42   = ~Why won't you say that you cannot lift it? Is it because you desire to have the brute strength that you so disdain?~
@43   = ~I do not disdain brute strength. It is quite useful when it comes to performing mundane tasks of manual labor. As it is readily available, both from adventuring stock and beasts of burden, I see no point in rivaling them in this particular, er... talent.~
@44   = ~I am, however, gifted in abundance (as in everything else of importance) with stamina, which is a sign of a talented conjurer.~
@45   = ~Why so?~
@46   = ~Because I have to subdue denizens of the Lower Planes and other mighty entities to my will. Unlike others among us, whose talents and ambitions do not extend past dominating squirrels.~
@47   = ~Shadow Druids? Stay close, Jaheira. I remember that their kin in the Cloakwood were ready to kill you on sight.~
@48   = ~Worry not, ranger. I would like nothing more than to beat some sense into these stubborn heads.~
@49   = ~I expect no less from you, Jaheira. You are unbiased even to those who share your beliefs.~
@50   = ~The shadow filth claims to share the druids' beliefs, yet they cause more damage with their extreme tactics than they solve. Irreparable damage, at that.~
@51   = ~I am appalled by their enslavement of animals only to slay the people of Trademeet.~
@52   = ~This is but one example of their hypocrisy! One cannot preserve balance by exterminating a large part of it.~
@53   = ~There is a faction among my people - Eldreth Veluuthra - that stands for restoring elven supremacy in the world by whatever means it takes. When I look at the state of my kin and see its inevitable demise- ~
@54   = ~Kivan, you're sounding like that Evereskian, Xan. This is unhealthy.~
@55   = ~There was a reason for his melancholic demeanor, Jaheira.~
@56   = ~I admit that a part of me commiserates with extremists. Part of me greatly desires my people restored to their former glory and lands. But would one defy history itself? No matter how I cast it, it seems that a war against N'Tel'Quess will only hasten the decline of the elves.~
@57   = ~And you are right; there is a difference between wishful thinking and realistic plans. To destroy and kill in the name of something that cannot be is criminal. But we have tarried long enough. It's time to confront the shadow kin.~
@58   = ~My Lady Fentan, I am most pleased to be introduced to you. I have heard the most favorable things about you and your group.~
@59   = ~None of the group are here to trade a tale or share a glass of wine with. Shadows took them all.~
@60   = ~I mourn with you. I know from my own experiences that one's own wound does not hurt as much as those of friends'.~
@61   = ~I was under the impression that you are a loner, Kivan.~
@62   = ~I have not always been a loner, Mazzy. Once I had family, friends, and beloved. We were so young and restless and we almost believed ourselves truly immortal... but the fates decreed otherwise. War took some and the bandits killed my Deheriana, my last ray of moonlight. With a glass of Everquist, I wish to honor their memory.~
@63   = ~So do I. To Patrick, my beloved!~
@64   = ~(quietly) To Deheriana.~
@65   = ~To Andrea and her little pseudo-dragon! I swear, I miss the little bugger.~
@66   = ~To Tinuvil and Arenel, my valiant brothers.~
@67   = ~To Khalid, the light of my eyes!~
@68   = ~Shut up, you crows! Let the dead be!~
@69   = ~I shall join in. To Dynaheir! None could summon a fireball with such a grace! To Khalid, the man who won each battle with due humility!~
@70   = ~Your conversation is making me sad, for I have a list of friends lost, as well. Would you not drink quietly?~
@71   = ~Do not let your sorrow cloud your hearts, friends. We will all die eventually. I say let it be on the battlefield!~
@72   = ~To Khalid and Dynaheir!~
@73   = ~Why would you not join us instead? Mayhap you would feel better if you drink with us for our brave friends who will not lift their glasses again.~
@74   = ~Nalia?~
@75   = ~Excuse my manners, Kivan. I did not mean to stare. But... but I cannot help but notice that you never finish your food.~
@76   = ~Tavern maids have a peculiar habit to put more on my plate than I have asked for. Elves do not require as much sustenance as other races, but they only laugh at me when I try to explain that... and add another morsel.~
@77   = ~I do not know if that's the case amongst elves, but I am quite certain that among humans, it is a common sign of courting.~
@78   = ~When so many children are starving in the world it is so... wasteful.~
@79   = ~O, Nalia, in an establishment like this one, the food will not be wasted. It will be returned to a pot... Nalia? What's wrong?~
@80   = ~Ewww... I... I just hope that majority of the clientele here... do clean their plates.~
@81   = ~The Keep of de'Arnise is a somber place. I remember thinking the same about the Ducal Palace in Baldur's Gate. For being creatures of the sun, humans have a remarkable love for cold, closed spaces.~
@82   = ~I love the Keep, Kivan. I spent all my childhood there, and I have many fond memories of my relatives and friends coming to visit us. My rooms were beautiful and sunny... Of course, I did not have to share it with others, either. (Her lips turn into a narrow line.)  It is not entirely appropriate, this custom of the 'peasant' rooms so many inns practice.~
@83   = ~But, of course, so many of the less fortunate have no roof over their head that they have to... make amends.~
@84   = ~I am unfortunate when I *have* a roof over my head rather than starry skies.~
@85   = ~For a race that is rumored to be the most ancient of all civilizations, elves have a remarkable love for barbaric existence.~
@86   = ~That is why my kin are called wild elves, my Lady de'Arnise.~
@87   = ~Phhht! Cheap junk. One long fart'd reduce the best piece here to splinters.~
@88   = ~I do not know what appalls me more - your rudeness or your coldhearted foulness, dwarf. My ancestors must have hired one of your kin, and it is built sturdily enough to contain the misfortunate! I... I can only despise them and their accomplices in this foul construction. I was so glad when my father locked it... and now... now it is back. Will everything I do be forever tainted by the cruelty of my predecessors?~
@89   = ~*That* is your reaction to such vileness, Korgan?! An appraisal?~
@90   = ~Sure. Don't shoddy goods and worse upkeep boil yer blood none?~
@91   = ~I should have guessed. Viscera being your raiment of choice, you would adorn yourself in any way that you can.~
@92   = ~Here now! Don't compare nothin' t' the blossoms of battle! Torture's just somethin' ye got t' know, like minin' or stoneworkin'.~
@93   = ~Ah, just another useful trade to the 'noble' dwellers of the underground warrens.~
@94   = ~Now and again, it is. When a fella knows somethin', the rack, tongs and iron lady used proper to be sure mean t' find out *what* he knows. Other times, they're just a bit of fun set out fer someone ye hate. Ye be workin' towards that end yerself, in case I got t' tell ye.~
@95   = ~Wretch! There is nothing new you can tell me on that subject...~
@96   = ~Kivan... I just wanted to-~
@97   = ~Hades! What does one do? Apologize forever?~
@98   = ~Let us go, Nalia. If we should be victorious, we shall lock these dismal vaults, and nobody will ever be burned, flogged or flailed here again. We will lock it well, so it cannot be unlocked again.~
@99   = ~I shall. I only wish I could lock away my memories so easily.~
@100  = ~Figures! A score of trolls left t' kill, and ye two go natterin' on 'bout interior decoratin'.~
@101  = ~Ah-Hah! 'Tis a grand boast that we won't be greetin' *that* feller again by light of day! But say, you leaf-licker! Yer might take a better angle to yer needle-point. Twice there, yer wee dainty darts nigh singed me beard from the arrears of me.~
@102  = ~They came no closer than they needed to.~
@103  = ~Then yer hand wanders. Or be ye unsure which is yer target of true choice?~
@104  = ~I shoot at will when the foes crowd us, when aiming for a particular target is impossible. If you do not want to be hit by a stray arrow, do not venture too far behind the enemy's line. You can be mistaken for a monster too easily that way.~
@105  = ~Aye. But thrice pays fer all, so consider yerself warned. It happens agin, 'n' we see how yer dancin' 'n' dartin'll do by ye, face-on-face.~
@106  = ~In a battle of faces, I would concede. No misfortune could render mine as terrible as your own.~
@107  = ~Bah. I canna say if ye be talkin' sense or insult but ye be right either way. Just ye remember this one time that ye *was* right.~
@108  = ~Elf, I've been thinkin' of peace and contentment. And ye...~
@109  = ~*I* occur in your thoughts of peace and contentment? This must be truly a unique moment.~
@110  = ~Aye. I'll be set to relax me bones a bit. And ye; ye won't tip a cup nor tup a wench like no live un, so I've been thinkin' that my peace and contentment'll be best served by ye takin' yer moanin' and bleetin' off to some hilltop where the moon won't mind yer company as I would.~
@111  = ~I think my efforts entitle me to honest shelter no less than yourself.~
@112  = ~Then yer thinkin's of no more account than the rest of ye. I'll allow ye the stable - if it's rainin' - but no nearer. Understood?~
@113  = ~Your kin is famed for its generosity, and at every turn I see a confirmation of it from you, dwarf. But I should be ungrateful and rest where I choose.~
@114  = ~Then I'd best see to it that ye blight no more inns. 'Less there's a call in one for elfmeat casserole.~
@115  = ~You are both out in the cold tonight. I'm sick of your yapping at each other! Who'd knew that it would be so difficult to keep an elf and a dwarf off each other's throats?~
@116  = ~Korgan! You do more harm than good. Get the hell out of my sight!~
@117  = ~I think it is obvious that we are both disillusioned in our old friendship. You do not like my new companions and I... frankly, I do not care for what you think, nor if you think at all any longer. So I gather it's time for us to part... before I do order an elfmeat casserole! ('Twas a good one, Korgan!)~
@118  = ~Can we all please, please settle down? We are all tired! Alternatively, should I finish to<DAYNIGHT> with a glamorous slaughter of my own allies?~
@119  = ~Ye want t' see *harm*? I'll learn ye harm, ye bowelhive!~
@120  = ~I... I am glad to travel in your company. It is nice to meet kin at last.~ [KIVAN 99]
@121  = ~Meeting both <CHARNAME> and you is a bit like... returning.~
@122  = ~It is difficult to be sundered from your community, Aerie, and as time passes it becomes ever harder, not easier.~
@123  = ~Quayle... Quayle told me differently, but he is not an elf. I... I will never be able to return to the avariel. Whatever would happen to me?~
@124  = ~I do not know your future, Aerie, but you are yet young in your years, and perhaps you will be able to find kinship among the land-dwelling elven kin.~
@125  = ~I... think... I can. I relate to you more than... than ever I did to Quayle. I rejoice at that.~
@126  = ~I... think... I can. I relate to <CHARNAME> and you more than... than ever I did to Quayle. I rejoice at that.~
@127  = ~Aerie, I am glad that it relieves your sorrow, but my time here is short. I can guide you to the Forest of Tethir or to Shilmista, if you desire to find refuge there from the persecutions of the curious and cruel. I will be traveling south as soon as <CHARNAME> is out of danger.~
@128  = ~Aerie, I am glad that it relieves your sorrow, but <CHARNAME>'s path is uncertain, and my time is short. I can lead you to the Forest of Tethir or to Shilmista even, if you desire to find refuge there from the persecutions of the curious and cruel. I will be traveling south as soon as <CHARNAME> is out of danger.~
@129  = ~Perhaps... perhaps <CHARNAME> can come, as well...~
@130  = ~Or, perhaps, the two of you will not require the services of a guide.~
@131  = ~Kivan, you... you said you knew something of s-suffering? Please, tell me.~ [KIVAN 99]
@132  = ~Several years ago, my wife, Deheriana was captured and... she was slain by Tazok's bandits.  That is how I met <CHARNAME>: <PRO_HESHE> was hunting the foul ogre, as well, and together we rid the world of him.~
@133  = ~I... I'm really sorry for you, K-kivan.  At least you had your v-vengeance.~
@134  = ~Indeed.  But what of the men responsible for your capture and mutilation? Did they too pay for their cruel acts?~
@135  = ~No... no, they d-didn't. They simply cast me aside when I... when I lost what it was that m-made me of interest to them.~
@136  = ~So they live, despite all they did to you and most likely countless others?~
@137  = ~Y-yes. But I d-don't care anymore. All of that is behind me now.~
@138  = ~Then I envy you.~
@139  = ~Shevarash is not a... kind deity, Kivan.~ [KIVAN 99]
@140  = ~I am not a kind man.~
@141  = ~That's... that's untrue. You help others... .~
@142  = ~I help others to kill their foes. That hardly makes me gentle.~
@143  = ~We all... all have to do battles. It is... it is on whose side you fight that makes all the difference. I... I never saw you to participate in an unjust cause. And... and killing does not give you joy.~
@144  = ~You were not there... in Baldur's Gate. Every cut which bled Tazok's life gladdened me.~
@145  = ~Every cut which bled Tazok's life gladdened me.~

@147  = ~I... I know that my question will hurt you, but aren't you afraid that... that Shevarash will lead you away from Deheriana?~ [KIVAN 99]
@148  = ~No.~

@151  = ~No... of course not!~
@152  = ~Will the Seldarine be crueler than you, Aerie, and forbid me the eternal love and peace for doing my duty? I did not betray my brethren or hurt my sisters.~
@153  = ~You have avenged your wife already... perhaps... perhaps another deity can heal the burning wounds of your heart.~
@154  = ~I do not fear grief. Shevarash gave me my life back, so Deheriana would not be forever dishonored, and so I put the end to the menace that stalked us. I will stay loyal to my faith for as long as I walk Faerun.~
@155  = ~You are limping.~ [KIVAN 99]

@159  = ~Unlace the top of your boot, and step out of it with your foot.~
@160  = ~I... I understood it. But why... why do you want me to go barefoot?~
@161  = ~I do not want you to go barefoot, Aerie. But there is an art of sorts to keeping your feet when walking for long time. And from the look of it, you have no knowledge of it. The blisters here and here are starting to rot. Heal them.~
@162  = ~Well... well, it's nothing at all... I cannot waste... a spell.~
@163  = ~For an adventurer, good footing is as important as keen senses and bodily strength. You have to be able to walk, run and jump without having to resist additional hurts.~
@164  = ~I... I know very little of walking. I fly... I was flying and then, when I was locked in the cage, there was room only for crawling. I... I could not stand straight, even.~
@165  = ~The circumstances have changed. Aerie, you have to roll your feet with cloth before putting your boots on. Here, I will show you how, and you will do it every time we start out. If you feel any inconvenience at all, you will stop and re-do the bindings.~

@170  = ~I do not know... It's... It's my face. Every time I look in a mirror, I keep wondering if... it's... it's how other people see me... and do they see me as a... circus freak, still. And then I start remembering how they... they gawked at me, when I was crouched in my cage, and my wings... hurt so much. I am sorry... I did not mean to... to do anything stupid, like breaking... a mirror. Humans say... humans say it is a bad luck..~

@204  = ~Aye, I see that you need a tale of bravery to raise your spirit. I shall tell you how Sir Jaime died. We were overwhelmed, and most of our losses were because of a primitive catapult the monsters installed atop a hill. Their aim was not good, fortunately, but every time they did not miss, a knight and a horse went down. Of course, our ranks held, for we were all young and brave. Suddenly the catapult went up in flames.~
@205  = ~Amidst the cheers and the following charge we did not notice the absence of Sir Jaime Aldario. It became known later that he made it 'round the monster's encampment and flung himself and the flasks of burning oil onto the catapult.~
@206  = ~Naturally, even among the Order's recruits there are wicked tongues always ready to belittle the great deed. Imagine, they said that Sir Jaime only did it when he perceived that he could not call away our battalion, committed to the charge.~
@207  = ~That is true, perhaps. The giants are not known for discipline, so should you have been able to disengage and feign an intention to attack later on, a few scouts could have taken the catapult down stealthily, once the foes' attention wavered, allowing you to advance with smaller losses.~
@208  = ~No offence, but you know nothing of warfare, elf. Men are at their most vulnerable during a retreat.~
@209  = ~If they break and run, yes, but if a retreat is structured it can be a winning strategy.~
@210  = ~Regardless, the day was won and I took command for a while - which was quite an honor for a squire, and I had slain-~
@211  = ~A dozen of the giants. The tale of thy deeds has reached my ears already, Anomen.~
@212  = ~You do have a... passable fighting skill, woodsman.~
@213  = ~I take it that you have just complimented me?~
@214  = ~Take it as you wish.~
@215  = ~Then a compliment it is. I feel quite privileged since it came from one of your kind. The sort that seem to believe their purpose in life to perform courageous deeds, undertake valiant tasks. The very embodiment of gallantry...~
@216  = ~Aye, I strive to be worthy of the Order's renown. I have done many deeds of valor, and I will continue to undertake the noble tasks until I fall on the battlefield.~
@217  = ~Tell me, for I am curious, what drives you? Is it the need to do good, or is it the gold and glory?~
@218  = ~Dare you doubt me? I have enough of those sniveling paper-pushers in the order who question... Enough of this! I shall be a knight, and I walk the path of righteousness. I battle the forces of darkness because it is the right and just thing to do!~
@219  = ~My fight is not so different from yours. I would seek out the evil ones to prevent them from harming the innocent and avenge the wrongs.~
@220  = ~Aye, our goals are the same - to smite the abominations.  Now, unless you're all talk, let us go and serve our cause!~
@221  = ~There is a troubadour's song of the elf-friend and a fair maiden. Quite inappropriate actually, but it set me thinking. I hear you came running on the rumor of <CHARNAME>'s disappearance.~
@222  = ~<CHARNAME> is a fair maiden indeed, and I did come running.~
@223  = ~Right. I guess, with you two being elves... it is better that way anyway.~
@224  = ~(You blush and turn away hastily.) ~
@225  = ~Anomen, should I come to be inadvertently smitten by Kivan's subtle charms, I'll let you know, since you seem to take quite an... erm... idle interest in the matter. By the way, such curiosity befits an old wife rather than a knight.~
@226  = ~Bah, Anomen, quit these silly questions already and give us the song!~
@227  = ~Anomen, Kivan's heart is given to someone other than I.~
@228  = ~In traditions of chivalry, I shall warn you that some of us may have gentle interest in the fair lady, and may suspect competition from you.~
@229  = ~My lady, I assure you that I shall not engage in such idle chatter again.~
@230  = ~(He arches a brow at you.) Subtle charms?~
@231  = ~My lady, but I cannot! It is a bawdy verse made up by an idle mind and spread around by a flapping tongue. May I offer instead to perform a ballade, one more suitable for the enjoyment of your gentle sex.~
@232  = ~But thank you, <CHARNAME>, for distracting our young friend. I do hope that listening to the ballade will prove a pleasant pastime.~
@233  = ~(sigh) I just hope it's limited to seven verses. You owe me one, elf!~
@234  = ~Yes, of course. Anomen does everything well!~
@235  = ~(Smile and touch Kivan's hand.) I am sorry about this small incident, my friend.~
@236  = ~I am dreadfully sorry, my lady, that this... idle chatter reached your ears. It was most unchivalrous to discuss things of that nature.~
@237  = ~You did not have to... save me the explanations, <CHARNAME>.~
@238  = ~(sigh) Perhaps, but I thought it would be the best that way. You owe me one, elf!~
@239  = ~You? What do you have to do... Oh! Heh, I just thought that Anomen is too shy. He needs... encouragement.~
@240  = ~(Smile and touch Kivan's hand.) I am sorry about this small incident, my friend.~
@241  = ~Anomen, I have a wife I love, and friends I am loyal to. That is all that you need to know.~
@242  = ~Would you take a string of wild berries in repayment?~
@243  = ~I am glad that it was resolved to everyone's satisfaction.~
@244  = ~We have been through worse.~
@245  = ~Shy? Anomen?~
@246  = ~Sir Anomen Delryn. That is a proud name and requires valiant deeds to match.~
@247  = ~You have already done your greatest deed, human.~
@248  = ~Speak not in riddles, elf! Surely, you cannot mean that being anointed as a knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart steals valor out of men!~
@249  = ~I speak of you staying your hand when it was ready to fall on innocents and your judgment was clouded and confused. That was the most horrible choice, and the one who has once elected that an innocent shall not suffer in order to avenge the crimes of the guilty will forever remember that and will not hesitate again.~
@250  = ~Aye, you now speak truly and wisely. But in thine own case, elf, I cannot help but think that an innocent is being punished.~
@251  = ~Now you have puzzled and scared me.~
@252  = ~I meant thyself, Kivan. I felt as if a millstone was oppressing my soul ever since Moira's death, the desire for revenge and the inopportunity to carry it out. Yet, ever since it was passed to those who will deal with it properly, I am whole again.~
@253  = ~If you want to find an innocent man, look elsewhere, Sir Delryn. My guilt is great, and my punishment is grave to match.~
@254  = ~My love, I know that there are those who preach that a true knight should stay away from the earthly pursuits, but you have proven me that true love is the strongest forger of spirits devoted to goodness.~
@255  = ~If I understood you correctly, you are not intending to stay celibate, which suits me just fine, lover.~
@256  = ~Anomen, I wanted to talk to you about it for a while, but tarried needlessly. There won't be a better time to say it. I... I lied to you, Anomen. There, in the rooms of Saerk, in the face of my comrades I lied to you, when I professed my love for you.~
@257  = ~Anomen, what I said, I said in a turmoil of passions and to avert a great beast which was tearing you apart. I see how your spirit has hardened since, and I deem that it is now invincible. I beg humbly of you to forgive me my insincerity.~
@258  = ~Beloved, your words foretell many things beautiful and good. They mean that devotion and sweet love shall be everlasting betwixt us.~
@259  = ~Only a man who had not known you can contemplate celibacy, my fiery <CHARNAME>.~
@260  = ~I am not a sage, <CHARNAME>, but I think that old Alaundo forgot to add a prophecy about you that was not ugly and terrible. Thus I did it in his stead, beloved.~
@261  = ~Your love was a... lie? It wounds me deeply, but you lied for my salvation. Perhaps, the words you have said then were not as far away from truth as you believe presently. Under grave circumstances our tongues do reveal what is hidden on the very bottom of our souls.~
@262  = ~Anomen, I know full well how I feel about you. I do not love you, knight. And I never will.~
@263  = ~I love you as I might have loved my brother, should he not have turned out to be the worst sort of a murderer and a madman to boot.~
@264  = ~I indeed tried to love you in a fashion that a wife should love her husband, but I am unable to order my heart. It has been given by fate to someone who neither needs it, nor suspects my plight. I will not have you suffer the role of the second best, Anomen.~
@265  = ~There is no cure then.~
@266  = ~What are you talk - Oh, Sarevok.~
@267  = ~You are confused, beloved, as can be expected of a person as young and as innocent as you are. If one day, amidst the darkness, you start searching for the light of love, I hope that you will look into my heart for a star to lead you to the sunlit lands.~
@268  = ~I will wait, beloved. This ill affliction may yet pass.~
@269  = ~I could have been one of those fools who went starry-eyed at the sight of monsters in Windspear. I bet that each hoped to carve a legend for himself with his sword. (spits) Aye, good thing it is that I had enough brains to quit the Order.~
@270  = ~I read that amongst the humans those who have discovered a new faith oft become the most fervent devotees. I see that it works for the opposite case, as well. The one who just lost his faith thus turns in the most avid hater of it.~
@271  = ~My faith in Helm is unshaken, elf.~
@272  = ~But you curse the Order more than ten orcs caught in an ambush on a rainy day.~
@273  = ~It's all well deserved!~
@274  = ~I remember Ajantis well. He was a good man, if too hot-headed. From what he said, his mentors did what they could to cool down his ambitions and tried to teach him to think of helping rather than of punishing. Even if that was not so, the strictest guidance does not take away the ability or necessity to think.~
@275  = ~Have you ever been in training every waking hour of your day? Have you been asked to repeat the same postulates over and over, until they sounded like absolute truth? Have you ever been shunned for saying what was on your mind? Have you -~
@276  = ~No.~
@277  = ~Then take it from one who has - those in the Order who still know how to think never make it up in the chain of the command, and they sooner or later all become renegades.~
@278  = ~So, Kivan, are you looking forward to our next glorious victory?~
@279  = ~Not as much as you do, Sir Anomen.~
@280  = ~Laugh all you want, but since I was knighted, I have come to realize that I have more responsibilities than simply striking down evil where'er it rears its ugly head.~
@281  = ~Do share your revelations then, sir.~
@282  = ~Honor, for instance.~
@283  = ~Honor? What good is that when a city is in flames, when innocent lie dead at your feet, when your beloved is dead in your arms...~
@284  = ~Aye, 'tis even more important to keep your honor then than on a jousting field.~
@285  = ~As long as you realize that sometimes one has to forsake honor to do what is right.~
@286  = ~Ah, Kivan, must you always make things look hopeless?~
@287  = ~I am glad that <CHARNAME> arrived in time to save you from captivity and execution, druid.~ [KIVAN 99]
@288  = ~I am quite grateful to your company for delivering me from the somber hole under the dwelling. The mayor is a noble man, but he could not comprehend that keeping me locked in the basement was as sure way to force my spirit to escape my body as cutting my head off. Amusing, that.~
@289  = ~You have the sound of a man who has little fear of death. This is rarity against humans, and always did my kin welcome this in druids. For there are many reckless and dangerous things humans do for being afraid of passing.~
@290  = ~It is not the death itself that I fear, but how it comes. I would have been as happy as a sparrow, sunbathing for the first time in the spring, to come out and die under the sky wide opened above my head with the rustle of leaves whispering to my ears. Yet wasting away without sunlight and breeze is repulsive, for I am not a mole or a worm.~
@291  = ~Stay with us, and mayhap you will get your wish. I have discovered, however, that adventurers have to crawl through underground mazes in the manner of the dwarven folk more often than I like.~
@292  = ~Cernd, I know that you were a man fully grown when you started your journey as a druid. Was it a revelation then? A sudden change of heart?~ [KIVAN 99]
@293  = ~May I trouble you for your story? Among my kin there are people who would sacrifice themselves for their purpose, but generally fervor and constancy like this we give to one another, not a cause.~
@294  = ~Gladly.~
@295  = ~The first time I thought of devoting myself to serving Silvanus was when I was a youngster. We stayed at my father's country house that summer. It was a first time that I have ran freely in the countryside, enjoying the breadths it offers to a boy.~
@296  = ~Between the taste of wild strawberries, the sensation of the hot noon sun on my cheeks, and the smell of freshly cut grass, I liked the sound of a bird that sang near every night. Of course, being a boy, I did not tell anyone of that. One night I heard... or rather not heard... silence in the courtyard - the bird did not sing.~
@297  = ~Apparently, the nightingale's absence also saddened my mother, who commented it at dinner. My father replied grumpily that the village boys must have been at stealing birds' eggs again in the hedge around the manor.~
@298  = ~Allow me to venture a guess - it was your doing?~
@299  = ~True. It was then that I knew just how fragile the Great Mother's creatures were... Hence came longing to learn more and protect it.~
@300  = ~Blind fury is something that nature harbors, as well as eternal harmony, yet the actions of the Shadow Druids seem to be guided more by human emotion than nature's will.~ [KIVAN 99]
@301  = ~Which emotion would that be?~
@302  = ~Despair. Impatience. The Great Mother is never desperate and never impatient.~
@303  = ~There is a reason to despair, Cernd. Where the great forests once stood, now there is nothing but grass pastures and fields of wheat. The Forest of Tethir was nigh destroyed out of malice alone, not even out of any mercantile interest. Cormanthyr... I understand why some of my kin in Maztica greet every human with a volley of well-aimed arrows.~
@304  = ~I know of these bleeding wounds, Kivan, and of many more. Redressing them is the goal of the healer, not chasing after the ones who caused them.~
@305  = ~My Deheriana was a healer, Cernd, and she fought when the orcs came to burn and despoil the Forest of Shadows. It was never in her to surrender humbly.~
@306  = ~With so many creatures seeking to live in the world, the conflicts are unavoidable, and such struggle is the part of the Great Balance. But I suspect that the Shadow Ones disturb rather than protect it.~
@307  = ~I would have comforted you, but there seems to be no need. You are not a passionate man, Cernd, but the coolness with which you have accepted the death of the woman who shared your bed and bore you a child is unnerving.~ [KIVAN 99]
@308  = ~I wished to see the wizard punished for his cruelty, but death itself is a natural thing and ensures that the cycles continue.~
@309  = ~Despite all your beliefs... do you feel whole, Cernd?~
@310  = ~Kivan, I ask you for your own sake to stop this questioning.~
@311  = ~Kivan, your inability to accept mortality is quite strong, even for one of your kin.~ [KIVAN 99]
@312  = ~We all must depart from the Prime Plane, Cernd, and I am reconciled with it.~
@313  = ~But you resent Deheriana's death and her ability to die. Your desire of revenge and unrest grew from it, and they hold you strongly.~
@314  = ~I had a chance to guide her to the safety of death, when I heard the steps of Tazok's bandits closing on us from all sides. Yet I could not spill her lifeblood. I betrayed my creed, and I left my wife to the torture. That is what I cannot accept.~
@315  = ~Kivan, if she died by your hand, would you be a merry person now?~
@316  = ~I would have been in Arvanaith with her, if I possessed enough courage then. This is all I know.~
@317  = ~Aha! This one is a linnet's song... I have one on you, Kivan.~ [KIVAN 99]
@318  = ~And so it would have been, if that was not a cross beak, which I had pointed out to you only yestereve.~
@319  = ~Comrades, why would you be making bets about birds without this little sparrow? A man of grimmer nature might have taken it as a slight.~
@320  = ~Not to doubt the sharp elven eyesight and hearing, but Kivan, I am sure that it was a linnet.~
@321  = ~Should I shoot it down for proof, Cernd?~
@322  = ~Kivan! No! How could you even think of such a thing? Lower your bow!~
@323  = ~I am a hunter, Cernd. And the game is the game.~
@324  = ~Surely, a linnet is too small to eat!~
@325  = ~Anything can go into <CHARNAME>'s stew. In the days long past, when we chased bandits near Baldur's Gate, Montaron the halfling caught a rat, and it took a lively argument to talk him out of adding that flavorful component to our dinner.~
@326  = ~Tell you what, Kivan: I must have misheard the bird's song. Let's call it a tie, shall we?~
@327  = ~Certainly.~
@328  = ~Can you talk to me, Cernd? There is a healing quality to your speech.~
@329  = ~What I need to tell you will not take calmly, Kivan. Your woman walks in twilight, and I do not know if it is an evening dawn or that of the morning. You wronged nature, elf.~
@330  = ~But there is hope?~
@331  = ~The Great Mother sometimes heals the wounds done to her by her children. Mayhap she will correct your error.~
@332  = ~And besides that? I do not know for how much longer I can idly watch her light go ever dimmer...~
@333  = ~It is said that those who have the "why" to live can bear almost any "how." From all the people I knew, you gripped to that why the strongest... and you still have it. Harden your heart, my friend, for there is nothing else to it.~
@334  = ~It is amusing to watch how much worse one can do than my lowest expectations. Of course, I ever judge others from the point of view of my divine intellect, and therefore I am bound to overestimate the abilities of random simians who have been gifted unwittingly with speech.~ [KIVAN 99]
@335  = ~If you intend to be of any use, you'd better apply your intellect to studying scrolls and mixing potions.~
@336  = ~It speaks! That is a development since we last met. (Unlike a general rule, however, in your case it is a regression.)~
@337  = ~Ah, do not stare at me with such single-minded disapproval, ranger. You are not worthy of being my foe. A man's enemies should be at the least of a similar scale with the man.~ [KIVAN 99]
@338  = ~When we last met, you were recruiting murderers to kill a powerful wizardess. This time, you were looking for assassins to kill a common scum. I conclude that you have diminished in scale.~
@339  = ~You might have mastered the art of words - especially the monosyllabic ones - but you will clearly never be able to understand anything more complex than battle cries. Now, if you would remove your ignorant self from my scroll case... (When will these simians learn NOT to step on it every time we take a break?)~
@340  = ~I shall turn my attention to someone whose intellect is comparable, though nonetheless inferior, to mine own.~
@341  = ~What now?!~ [KIVAN 99]
@342  = ~A mad wizard takes <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> companions into custody, Dynaheir is murdered, and Edwin has taken to running errands for the Athkatlan Thieves' Guild.~
@343  = ~Elf, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to memorize these many events. Your tiny head had not been devised in such a way as to allow cohesive thoughts.~
@344  = ~What interests me the most is that whether these events are coincidental or they are part of a pattern. I would not put it past you to arrange a scheme both mad and complicated to prove yourself to your superiors. And I would not put past the torturer of <CHARNAME> to be devious enough to trick you into believing that you are the one in charge, while setting up his tenets to catch <CHARNAME> with your hands. By the Black Bow, it is not that challenging.~
@345  = ~Simian, go daydream of that Tazok creature or whatever else puts you in the murderous mood for which <CHARNAME> keeps you around.~
@346  = ~I will watch you, Edwin, for I have no proof. Beware.~
@347  = ~When I see you in combat, Haer'Dalis, I start to understand the small amount of envy that I have heard in the voices of the humans when they call elves "lightfooted"~
@348  = ~Ah, add a touch of a fiendish blood to any race, and thou wilt be amazed at the result of such an experiment. It serves this sparrow well enough in his duty...~
@349  = ~Duty? I thought that you have no other lord but yourself.~
@350  = ~My loyalty is not to a person, my sharp-eyed kestrel, but to a grander thing. In Sigil, philosophy is what moves all things, and I wield my weapons with the agility that caught your eye for the dogma of my Faction.~
@351  = ~Doomguard?~
@352  = ~I see you have been paying attention to what others say, as is often a custom of the quiet and aloof. Alas, while I am interested enough in testing the limits of primes' ability to understand the abstract ideas, the raven is flapping <PRO_HISHER> wings and calling for us to fly after <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@353  = ~Ah, the luscious flora of this world fills this sparrow's eyes with wonder and his heart with songs.~
@354  = ~Then again, what does not?~
@355  = ~Solemn as ever. One would think 'twas you, not I, who was born in the Demonweb Pits, nurtured by the flames of at least seven of the Hells, and came into manhood under the acidic rains of Sigil.~
@356  = ~If that indeed was your upbringing -~
@357  = ~Not without a poetic exaggeration or two. Artistic license, my kestrel.~
@358  = ~Naturally.~
@359  = ~Are you counting each word you are saying? Do you have a daily limit?~
@360  = ~I am relieved. I was about to panic that I inadvertently exhausted your quota on this little friendly chat about nature.~
@361  = ~Nature? Oh, yes, I seem to recall that you had mentioned plants a while back.~
@362  = ~Tsk, tsk. You do not credit my sincere admiration of all the leafy greenery, berry-laden shrubbery and colorful blossoms? What if I were to tell you that in Sigil, we have but one plant?~
@363  = ~It must be a hardy plant to survive acidic showers.~
@364  = ~Indeed. 'Tis called razorvine. A voracious and thorny thing it is - grows everywhere, and so quickly that some citizens cultivate it as protection for their houses. Others brew hard spirit out of it: razorwine, for the lack of a more imaginative name. One drop would kill your kind, I'd hazard to guess.~
@365  = ~Well, thank you for the warning: I will remember to stay away from this green menace, should I ever find myself in Sigil.~
@366  = ~'Tis not green either, my kestrel. 'Tis black: I used to hate the sight of those black, glossy leaves. So... somber.~
@367  = ~The primes love their cities, it seems.~
@368  = ~I do not love cities.~
@369  = ~Then you be missing much. You let the natural wonders, which, I grant, are spectacular on the Material Plane, blind you to the beauty of the things created by the sentient creatures' mind and hands.~
@370  = ~I see the beauty, bard, but I do not love it. You said that Sigil has no plants; no animals as well, I gather. You can hardly understand what it means to wake in the deep of the forest and listen for the wakening birds, looking at the sky turning from green to golden to blue... The most fanciful work is but a pale parody compared to it.~
@371  = ~Ah, kestrel, let me tell you this: Sigil has no stars.~
@372  = ~Starless skies... what could be worse?~
@373  = ~Not starless, Kivan. If I lift my eyes there, on the rare days when the breeze would blow the smog away, the sky would be covered by a myriad of lights, and every time, I would behold a different sight. They shift and change, just like your stars, the lights of Sigil.~
@374  = ~What are these heavenly bodies?~
@375  = ~The lights in the windows of the houses on the other side of Sigil.~
@376  = ~How? Do you mean the glare that one sees around cities in the night from the mountainside?~
@377  = ~No, my kestrel, I mean the lights of Sigil. As all inhabitants of the Outer Planes know, 'tis shaped as a ring, and the city occupies the inner walls. So wherever you go in Sigil, above you is Sigil. The lights change because this ring is never the same - it expands, and contracts, and shifts at will.~
@378  = ~I do not understand.~
@379  = ~No Primer does. The laws of Nature are too restrictive for Sigil, so Sigil chooses to ignore them. Your logic has no place on the peak of the Infinite Spire of the Outer Planes.~
@380  = ~The peak of the *Infinite* Spire?~
@381  = ~Sigil hovers over it - the impossible city that has an infinite number of faces and an infinite number of portals to every place in the Multiverse.~
@382  = ~You are telling me a strange tale, Haer'Dalis. Why would people settle a place like that, without a field and forest?~
@383  = ~Because 'tis a Nexus, Kivan, the intersection of all trade routes in the Multiverse, the City of Doors and the Cage.~
@384  = ~A City of Doors and a Cage - another fine example of Sigilian logic, I presume?~
@385  = ~This one a Primer can understand: no matter how many doors a cage has, 'tis still a cage. 'Tis not the locks, either, that make it a cage. You ponder that one, kestrel, 'tis a good one.  You are slow to catch on, but what you know, you know well.~
@386  = ~My kestrel, a song came to my mind...~ [KIVAN 99]
@387  = ~Three things a man cannot stop - an avalanche coming down the mountain slope, a woman falling in love with him, and a bard singing a song.~
@388  = ~Surely, there are more than these three...~
@389  = ~Perhaps. But those are the ones that came to mind. Name others, minstrel, and I will not argue.~
@390  = ~Ah, Kivan, but you are eluding marvelously the third one. It must be an extension of a woodsman's ability to dissolve into shadows. Yet, I elect to prove you right, rather than wrong.~
@391  = ~Our summer has passed
As if it were a bluff
Sky's translucent as glass
But 'twas not enough

Life was doting on me
And I was cared for
I was lucky indeed
But I need something more...~
@392  = ~The melody is attuned to my mood, Haer'Dalis, but I find it hard to commiserate with the words.~
@393  = ~I thought that you would not.  Peculiar, though, that you, who believes that he has nothing and desires but one thing, displays the same restlessness as the person who wrote this verse in a state of stifling wellness.~
@394  = ~Quite.~
@395  = ~This play, Haer'Dalis, the one that made you an exile from Sigil - what was in it that made a lord have a whole troupe of actors hunted down?~
@396  = ~'Twas whom the play was portraying, my kestrel. Duke Rowan Darkwood is counted one of the two most powerful people in Sigil.~
@397  = ~The portrayal was satirical, I presume?~
@398  = ~Worse than that, my kestrel. You see, the Duke came to Sigil not so long ago. And in less than a year, he controlled one of the most powerful Factions of Sigil. Such a feat cannot be accomplished without cross-trading and shadow dealings. I can only guess at how Raelis knew the truth, but she had apparently exposed intimate details of the Duke's meteoric rise in "A Comedy of Terrors."~
@399  = ~However, there were not enough hints before opening night for anyone to guess who the protagonist was.~
@400  = ~Not enough hints?~
@401  = ~Little is known of the Duke, but what is known is difficult to miss.~
@402  = ~I was to be a substitute for Alendor, who was to play the main role. But Raelis changed it at the very last minute.~
@403  = ~Because your performance was so inspired?~
@404  = ~I wish 'twas that. But it was my scars, Kivan. The Duke was tortured by a Baatezu named Armaggel for many years, and the memory of it is forever visible on his body. She also made me wear an eye patch and switch a costume. The new attire had a deck of playing cards embroidered on it.~
@405  = ~A deck of cards?~
@406  = ~Yes. The story goes that a minstrel sought shelter at Darkwood's abode once on a stormy night, and he took him in.  The next day, when the minstrel departed, he left a battered deck of playing cards behind that Darkwood's children began playing with.~
@407  = ~The deck was magical, and summoned a Baatezu named Armaggel, who laid claim to the children's souls.  The Duke offered Armaggel a deal - they would play one game of cards, and if the Duke won, his children would go free.  If he lost, he would offer himself to Armaggel, as well.  The fiend accepted, and they played their game.~
@408  = ~'Twas a close match, my kestrel.~
@409  = ~Did the Duke lose?~
@410  = ~The Duke won.~
@411  = ~Then the fiend broke his word?~
@412  = ~O, no. Armaggel could lay claim to the soul of whoever played the deck, and deal or no, the Duke had done just that.  True to his word, Armaggel spared his children, but took Darkwood with him back to the Nine Hells.~
@413  = ~I see. Why would you mock a man who went through such a torment?~
@414  = ~Tormented men are no rarity in Sigil. And politics is a dangerous game we all play.~
@415  = ~It almost cost you your freedom.~
@416  = ~It also saved our lives. We would not have escaped, if not for politics.~
@417  = ~How so?~
@418  = ~Sigil is the City of Doors, my kestrel, and the portals open and close on a whim of the Lady of Pain. One opened and let us through just as the Duke's men were about to seize us.~
@419  = ~Mercy is a commendable quality in a ruler.~
@420  = ~Perhaps, but the chant is that Duke secretly plots to take over the rule of the Cage.  And the Lady of Pain stayed in power for countless millennia by defeating every adversary that challenged her rule.  Laughter, Kivan, is the single greatest weapon against those in power.~
@421  = ~I am glad to see you again, Imoen.~
@422  = ~Heya, Kivan, never thought to meet you again with you going to Shilmista and all. How did you come to Athkatla?~ [KIVAN 99]
@423  = ~A chance meeting on the road, Imoen. I met a group of rangers who where trying to track down <CHARNAME> for the Great Dukes of Baldur's Gate. My tracking proved to be more successful than theirs, or perhaps their assignment simply did not require them to find <CHARNAME>, just search for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@424  = ~After all that saving the world and stuff, and we were left to fend for ourselves by the Dukes! Politics, huh?~
@425  = ~I do not know for sure, for I did not stay long with the company. I prefer... solitude.~
@426  = ~Yeah, that's why you're still traveling with us. Come on, Kivan, I'm sure you enjoy speaking with more than just your own reflection in a pool of water.~
@427  = ~With you around, lady, do I have a choice?~
@428  = ~Heh, well, you can always go find yourself a stream, you know.~
@429  = ~Yes?~
@430  = ~Now, Kivan, way back then... you were right. No amount of poultice helps some scars. They're here to stay.~ [KIVAN 99]
@431  = ~I am sorry that my grim forewarning has come to pass so soon.~
@432  = ~Heh, I sorta like them. I look... savvy. Yep. Savvy.~
@433  = ~There is also a different kind of beauty, one that has nothing to do with the face or the figure.~
@434  = ~Well, yeah, my internal beauty alone can knock a man off his feet, so it's only fair that I have a bit of a scratch here and there to mar my heavenly features. I mean, other maids should have their half-chance, even with me around.~
@435  = ~I am afraid that I am a poor judge of these matters.~
@436  = ~Yeah, I guess. But I'm a good one! And I tell ya, these scars are nothing to worry about.~
@437  = ~I am concerned, though, about the one who inflicted them. He is at large and can still cause much more harm than that.~
@438  = ~Not for long, trust me. Not for long.~
@439  = ~Yes, it was quite a challenge to kill that wyvern; even without keeping Khalid from throttling Coran for ogling Jaheira.~
@440  = ~You and Khalid were friends...~
@441  = ~He was a good and true man.~
@442  = ~I know... Well, *now* I know. Before I thought... I thought he was... well... a chicken.~
@443  = ~You were a young girl and judged by appearances. It is not the greatest sin, Imoen. The main thing was that you had never said a bitter word to him or insulted him. You were always kind, even when you teased him.~
@444  = ~Yeah, I knew he was a nice guy, but I didn't know just how brave he was. Kivan, the things I saw Irenicus do to him in my presence... I would have begged for mercy. In fact, I did... I could not watch what he did to him. I... I...~
@445  = ~Khalid is beyond the reach of pain now, and he died bravely. It is a poor consolation, Imoen, but it is all I can offer.~
@446  = ~He did die bravely, Kivan. He... he found me with his eyes and whispered: "Jaheira... don't tell Jaheira..." And Irenicus then said: "Amusing... What have you learned today, Imoen?" And I said that I hated him... and he just said: "Good, now I will prove to you that love does not exist." And he opened his chest to cut out Khalid's heart. He said that he'd let Jaheira eat it, and she... she would not know.~
@447  = ~We cannot let the cruelty of twisted men frighten us or, worse yet, rob us of feelings. I know that you have resisted, and my heart grows glad every time I see you to recover another bit of your old spirit.~
@448  = ~But he did change something inside me. I feel broken sometimes. And... I lied to Jaheira too, Kivan. I told her that he was... already dead. I never lied to Jaheira before. Well, not deliberately. It's like I've stolen something from her, and afraid to give it back.~
@449  = ~You did the right thing, Imoen. The only right thing. Jaheira has grieved enough.~
@450  = ~I know, but a selfish, nasty thing in me, it pushes me to tell her...~
@451  = ~I... I feel that I would find some relief, if I told her. Like passing a load from a pack to another. I see her every day, and I shut my mouth tight and I tell myself 'Don't ya dare!'~
@452  = ~I... I feel that I would find some relief, if I told her. Like passing a load from a pack to another. It's good she is not traveling with us, or I'd spill the beans.~
@453  = ~Talk to me, Imoen, whenever you feel that way. Perhaps it will make it easier on you.~
@454  = ~I think it already has, Kivan... Thank you.~
@455  = ~Imoen, I would rather be left alone just now.~
@456  = ~Huh, yes, of course...~
@457  = ~(She turns back to him abruptly.) Kivan, it will be alright with Deheriana. She is kinda ghostly now, but it will pass.~ [KIVAN 99]
@458  = ~Perhaps.~
@459  = ~Come on, don't lose faith! I know others think you did it all wrong, but...~
@460  = ~Imoen, thank you, but I did do a wrong thing- ~
@461  = ~Don't you go and sigh at me! Go sigh at her! Something's got to work. Something always works!~
@462  = ~Some battles cannot be won, Imoen.~
@463  = ~Yeah, especially if they're never fought. Listen, I don't care that you are two hundred years old, you're going to do what I tell you and work this out.~
@464  = ~I will do what I think is needed, Imoen.~

@476  = ~Jaheira, from what I have heard of their doings, it is the rule rather than the exception.~
@477  = ~You know nothing, Kivan! I have been with the Harpers for... erm... long enough. Flexibility and compromise are two major tactics employed by the organization.~
@478  = ~Their willingness to lose someone as dedicated to their cause as you are speaks of the opposite.~
@479  = ~That goes to prove that there is a worm at the very heart of the Athkatlan cell!~
@480  = ~Whatever you say.~
@481  = ~I have sensed that you had no use for words earlier, Jaheira, but I wish to tell you how much I miss Khalid's good-natured presence.~
@482  = ~You liked him, did you not?~
@483  = ~I was proud to call him my friend. Khalid was a kind man. He gave his friendship generously, and I never heard a cross word from his mouth.~
@484  = ~Too many mocked him for that!~
@485  = ~Do not waste your anger on those who are not worthy of it.~
@486  = ~Indeed, there is someone for whom I must save my wrath, like a good lass who keeps her maiden's gift for the marriage bed.~
@487  = ~I remember the song Khalid used to murmur when looking at you. And when other men start stuttering watching the object of their desire, he stopped.~
@488  = ~It... it's not uncommon for the stutter to disappear... when singing, I mean.~
@489  = ~Let the leaves whisper that song to you, Jaheira, and soothe your pain.~
@490  = ~My good elf, do you presume to tell a druid and a widow how her husband manifests himself through nature's wonders?~
@491  = ~Deheriana was quite accomplished in the lore of the stars. I feel her presence the most in the starlight, and I find a caress and a promise in that.~
@492  = ~Hmm.~
@493  = ~What have you done, elf?! Against everyone's best judgment, against common sense!~ [KIVAN 99]
@494  = ~Against common sense, but for love.~
@495  = ~For love?!~
@496  = ~Do you think that I never wished the joy of my heart restored to the sunlit world and the horror of Khalid's passing erased?~
@497  = ~I loved him enough, however, to let him go when his time came...~

@499  = ~Yours?~
@500  = ~Yes.~
@501  = ~Yours?!~
@502  = ~Look at this poor soul that you dropped to this plane. No one should do such thing to his beloved.~
@503  = ~Different people do different things for love, Jaheira. You released your husband and Kivan held on to me... do not berate him for the lack of love.~
@504  = ~(So she would defend him, if she were pushed hard. Perhaps there is hope yet.)~
@505  = ~Ah, but it is good to be away from the city. One breathes easier under the sylvan boughs.~
@506  = ~Too true, but I fear that this investigation will keep us away from Athkatla.~
@507  = ~I have noticed that you were reluctant to leave the City of Coin.~
@508  = ~Cowled Wizards do not exactly spend most of their time roaming in the wilderness. I like to keep my adversaries close at hand.~
@509  = ~I agree, but the reward we were promised for coming out here should provide us with enough money to pay for the passage to the mysterious place where they hold Imoen.~
@510  = ~And who knows what traps will be waiting for us there if we give our foes the time to hatch their plots, while we are in the backcountry!~
@511  = ~It is not our adversaries that worry me the most; it is our so-called allies.~

@514  = ~These are ill times, and we are cornered like deer by a pack of wolves.~
@515  = ~Then we better keep our antlers at the ready.~
@516  = ~And our hooves... and teeth. I feel that we'll need them all before this is over.~
@517  = ~Your healing ability is far greater than mine, Jaheira. Could you do nothing to relieve <CHARNAME>'s suffering?~
@518  = ~Do you think that I withhold healing?! Ever?!~
@519  = ~No. No. It was quite stupid of me to ask. But when I look at <CHARNAME>, I cannot help but think that there must be - if not a cure - *something* that can be done for <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@520  = ~A missing soul is not a scratch! There is nothing I can do but help accomplish the task we have set out to do: find Irenicus and wrestle <CHARNAME>'s soul from him. And we'd better attend to it instead of chattering.~
@521  = ~Kivan, drow males do not glower!~
@522  = ~I am sorry, O High Priestess of Lolth.~
@523  = ~If you don't learn to bend your stiff neck, we're going to be discovered and killed.~
@524  = ~If I were alone, I would rather die fighting drow than pretend to be one of them.~
@525  = ~This is Shevarash speaking, not a wise ranger that I know. Do you want your death to be as pointless as his?~
@526  = ~Pointless? I would be taking a few of them down to the Demonweb Pits! I'quelin Mori'Quessir naa ba Mori'Quessir. The best drow is a dead drow.~
@527  = ~You would be slain before you could scratch the toe of a drow, idiotic darthiir. Now shut up, before I take my whip to you. And ask my sisters to join me in punishing an insolent male.~
@528  = ~Kivan, no! She would do that! Drop your eyes, you stupid man. We are attracting attention. As for you, drow - you stand to suffer as much as all of us, should we be unmasked. From what I know of your kin, you risk worse than us, mere surfacers.~
@529  = ~Kivan, this is an ill-chosen time for you to have a bout of religious fervor.~
@530  = ~The Black Archer calls for action.~
@531  = ~And we do act. If we succeed in helping the dragon, we prevent a drow raid. What is it more important to you: to kill a few drow or to save many elven lives?~
@532  = ~I hear you, Jaheira. Maybe it is a test of my faith - to be a spy among my foes and emulate their vile ways for the sake of averting greater evil.~
@533  = ~None of us is pleased with this ruse, Kivan, but we must comply. Now lower your gaze, before I lose my patience and smack some sense into you.~
@534  = ~So, Kiv, I was looking at you, and it reminded me of my great-aunt Molly on my father's side, who was growing cucumbers. The thing was, the slugs devoured most of her crop every other year, and she grew so tired of it that she went to a druid who was her second daughter Stina's lover. Obviously, the daughter's husband did not know about it, and thought that all three children were his own, ignoring that they all were red-heads. He was blond, naturally...~ [KIVAN 99]
@535  = ~Jan...~
@536  = ~Molly told the druid of her problems, and he suggested that Molly should only plant her cucumbers ever other year and plant turnips in between. And garlic. You see, garlic distracts slugs.~
@537  = ~If garlic distracts slugs, why would he recommend her planting turnips?~
@538  = ~Ah! You put your finger right on it. You see, my family is famous for its passion for turnips, and he wanted to sweeten up the deal for his lover's mother.~
@539  = ~Women often go for the unavailable men, so Molly fell for the druid fellow. This infuriated Stina, and she told her husband that the druid was making passes at her. Her husband, being a stupid big ogre, ripped the druid's head right off his shoulders. Quite a clean cut, too. Very atypical.~
@540  = ~Looking at me reminded you of your cousin's twice removed ogre husband, Jan?~
@541  = ~Well, you are a widower, aren't you? And so was Stina... because you see, one of Stina's sons, Kibby, actually knew that he was the druid's, so he decided to avenge his father by killing the ogre, whom everyone thought to be his father, and -~
@542  = ~Enough!~
@543  = ~So Kibby was trying to kill the ogre for years and years, but mind you, the trick for him was to stage it as an accident, so the ogre had a great number of accidents like boulders dropping on him from crow's nests and other similar things. When Kibby finally succeeded, he dropped dead from exhaustion.~
@544  = ~And so it ended...?~
@545  = ~Oh, no! The best part was that Molly buried all of them side by side and planted cucumbers over their graves every other year. Which I find very touching.~
@546  = ~Indeed.~
@547  = ~So, Kivvy, what do you think about that turnip jelly we had another day?~ [KIVAN 99]
@548  = ~I try not to think about it, Jan. My stomach is still heaving.~
@549  = ~Hmm... that would explain that grayish tint on your cheeks. Typical for turnip stomach flu. And here I was thinking that you finally washed your face. Speaking of which, that reminds me of a fourth cousin of mine. He was just the same way about the turnip jelly. He even tried to mix it in with clay and make a brick... and use it to keep their cart from rolling downhill.~
@550  = ~And the cart said: "No, thank you?"~
@551  = ~Actually, no.~
@552  = ~I should have guessed. I would be surprised if it worked out, assuming that your cousin was a Jansen.~
@553  = ~Why, he most certainly was a Jansen! The way it happened is that he had founded a small factory fashioned from an old bread-oven and three bird cages, and was about to start the production when his prototype got stolen... Mysteriously, so was the cart. He didn't even get to try it out. We called him Sergio-who-put-a-cart-before-Brass ever since...~
@554  = ~How come you did not go into fruit peddling business, Kivvy? It must be slower than turnip market, of course, but still not bad of a profession for your sort.~
@555  = ~It had never occurred to me to devote myself to selling fruit, Jan.~
@556  = ~A pity that. With the name like yours, it just ought to be your true calling. Naturally, you denied it, and that's why even your turnips went rotten on you, if you don't mind me saying so. It's all in the name as my dear thrice removed auntie Bore used to say.~
@557  = ~My name, gnome? What's in my name?~
@558  = ~Why, is not it obvious, Kivvy? Just listen to it... It's nothing if not fruity.~
@559  = ~My name is Kiv-AN, and in the tongue of my people it means 'forest wind'.~
@560  = ~Aha, was not I saying all along that it's all in the name! You know, Kivvy, how they say that 'There is no such ill wind that blows nobody any good.' I was always of the opinion that all the good blowing comes at its own expense, and you are a living proof. Why, you even look ill!~
@561  = ~Your parents must have been just like my uncle Neen, who thought to give his children names that will be their talismans. So he called them Lucky, Wise and Royal. Unfortunately, the scribe who was recording the names was a perpetual drunk, so a few years down the road, Neen found out that the wretch put it down as Wacky, Vice and Boil. He used to say to his boys: "It's no doubt that you all turned out like you've turned out. It's not your fault." A fair man Neen was, quite fair.~
@562  = ~I see. Now, if we may go-~
@563  = ~That is why I say - name a child after a trade, and you'd not be disappointed, because no matter what kind of character he would be, at least he'd not have much doubts at where to apply himself.~
@564  = ~I presume that your own son will be named Monkey and Smuggler then, seeing that the trade that left you the fondest memories was the monkey smuggling business.~
@565  = ~Not bad! And if they would be twins, I can always call them Mon and Key. I do not like too complicated names, you see. Because there are always troubles with longish and outlandish names. Take my niece five times removed on my mother's side and twice removed on my father's side. She always said that her parents hadn't done her a favor after she married that dragon. It took a good three days before they could consummate the marriage because the priest could not pronounce them man err, dragon and wife.  He had a bit of a stutter, you see.~
@566  = ~Jan, if you would do *me* a favor and cast a silencing spell on yourself...~
@567  = ~You are just as irritable as that dragon. Luckily, you do not breathe fire. Poor priest, though...~
@568  = ~So a twice... no... thrice-removed... no... *very removed* relative of mine had once fallen in love with a girl called Olisa, and all but married her. But out of nowhere comes a dashing mage who seduces Olisa and weds her on the spot and all that. Obviously the relative of mine went adventuring to prove to the girl that she did not matter to him. Only when he came back in full glory, the girl had had a child by that very mage and the child was cursed, you see, by the father. Naturally, being a complete fool, the relative of mine...~ [KIVAN 99]
@569  = ~Jan, I always thought that you belong to the contemptuous breed that would not spare their own father for the sake of a witty word, but what you are doing now... I cannot help but to admire you, Jan.~
@570  = ~See, Kiv, we are not that different. Only you are a tad taller, but your nose is almost big enough for a gnome's. It is not that unusual among elves, mind you: the big hooked noses that they call "aquiline" on elves and tall proud men. Gnomes, they usually get the bulbous ones. This is how one can generally distinguish between the races... by how others regard their noses.~
@571  = ~There is nothing wrong with having a big nose, Jan. Bulbous or hooked.~
@572  = ~It can be a bit of a problem when kissing, which reminds me...~
@573  = ~Let us go, Jan, and keep our memories to ourselves.~
@574  = ~Yes... yes.~
@575  = ~You know, Kivan, my sister-in-law's cousin was a paladin and wanted to wipe out all evil and avenge every innocent victim who'd fallen to wrongdoers.~ [KIVAN 99]
@576  = ~A remarkable goal, for a Jansen.~
@577  = ~He was not a Jansen per se -- but to stay with the story I would not delve into his lineage -- but his sister, that very sister-in-law of mine, had a hereditary disease: she could not listen to a tale without interrupting it with meaningless remarks.~
@578  = ~Thus only prolonging her suffering.~
@579  = ~Maybe that is why her brother was so keen on eliminating evil, who knows? But the day came, and he got really tired of living that way. All that waking up in the small hours of the morning, showering in icy water - and he had his ice delivered to him from Lonelywood daily, mind you - and heroic endeavors throughout the day often without a break for lunch.~
@580  = ~Right.~
@581  = ~See, the problem was, as Devan put it, that nobody truly cared. Well, obviously, the peasants he saved from xvarts did, but aside from peasants, he had no wife, no child, no home, and no other connections. Except for his sister, of course. Well, and all the Jansens through her marriage, so maybe he did have connections... but anyway, where was I?~
@582  = ~Nowhere, as is your custom.~
@583  = ~Ah, yes, thank you. So it led Devan nowhere, because the monsters did not really give a damn about what suffering they caused, so it was entirely an unsatisfactory experience for him to come and yell at some, for example, ogre: "You have raped the wife of so and so! You will die for it!" and see a blank stare from the audience. So eventually he retired and started selling strawberries on ice since he already knew the suppliers. Good business too, but a bit of a problem with the seasons. You see, you have most of the ice delivered in the winter and most of the strawberries in the summer... the trick is to keep each of them long enough to combine and sell the two. Requires complicated magic, it does.~
@584  = ~Allow me to express my sympathy, Kivan. I am married myself, and should anything ill befall my wife...~
@585  = ~Are you a faithful servant of Torm, Sir Firecam?~
@586  = ~Then pray every night to your god that it would not come to pass.~
@587  = ~I do. As an inquisitor of the Order I have witnessed great grief and misfortune. Either corrupts a human's soul by the virtue of being unfair, but the wrongs that are done to those we love are the worst of them all.~
@588  = ~Is it *your* soul you are concerned about, then?~
@589  = ~Yes, for if my will should crumble, who would stand to right the wrong? Who would keep the justice?~
@590  = ~I often questioned the policy of my Order about not recruiting amongst the races other than humans.~
@591  = ~Then I must be a living example for you to become convinced that the Prelates are right.~
@592  = ~On the contrary, I trust that a young man like you would have gained a lot of comfort and contentment had he joined the Order. Indeed, I wish that I could have enrolled you as a squire.~
@593  = ~Your judgment is your own, Sir Firecam, but my heart does not call for rigid discipline. Neither do I have an affinity for faith in Torm or Helm.~
@594  = ~Perhaps. But it is not the discipline or faith that you are lacking in my eyes.~
@595  = ~What is it then?~
@596  = ~Integrity. Your single-mindedness is a dangerous thing and while many in the Order would disagree, had I trained you, I would have seen that you were healed before taking up the sword.~
@597  = ~I am as sound as I would ever be.~
@598  = ~I doubt it. Shevarash does not let you to step back an inch from the fire that burns you, and it hurts these old eyes to see it.~
@599  = ~I do not understand your decision, Sir Firecam. You do not love your wife anymore - so part with her. Why did you lock her in a jail like a murderer or a thief?~
@600  = ~Kivan... it never was my desire to... to incarcerate Maria.~
@601  = ~Then why?~
@602  = ~The law, elf, requires that the actions of Ryan and Maria were adequately punished.~
@603  = ~Adequately?! To be contained in a small chamber for life because of loving someone?~
@604  = ~The law is the law, Kivan, and it frowns upon adultery.~
@605  = ~It is a lowly law, for what man of honor would forget the years of happiness to gain a petty revenge for being scorned?~
@606  = ~Kivan, humans carry their honor through loyalty. Maria betrayed hers.~
@607  = ~Amin n'rangwa edanea. (I do not understand these humans.)~
@608  = ~I do not understand how a man can derive his faith from the notion of revenge.~
@609  = ~In our world, paladin, every notion is a foundation of someone's faith - hatred, fear, love - you name it. They are all equal before Ao.~
@610  = ~You are a decent man, and you are well aware of the dark side of vengeance. The one that degenerates from justice into violence.~
@611  = ~Tell me, Sir Firecam, does a paladin love goodness above all?~
@612  = ~And does not he express this love also through his hatred of evil?~
@613  = ~Kivan, no matter what you say, love could not be conveyed through hatred.~
@614  = ~Long have been people saying that there is but one step between the two.~
@615  = ~And just as long they were mistaken. Kivan, I know how strong love is in you. Why would not you put it on your banner? Especially now, that you have defeated your tormentor not once, but twice?~
@616  = ~I do not change my faith like a traveler changes his coats, Sir Keldorn. I serve Shevarash.~
@617  = ~I wish that you would bend your stiff neck before it is broken.~
@618  = ~For my kin it is customary to leave forests and explore the world when we are very young. Until meeting you, Sir Firecam, I presumed that humans do things no differently.~
@619  = ~Are you saying that I have seen too many winters to wield a sword, Master Elf?~
@620  = ~My observation was not intended as an affront to your skill, Keldorn, for it is superb.  But among my kin... even if we are capable, we return to our lands and seek adventures no more once matured.~
@621  = ~I myself would berate a man of my advanced age, should he be out in the field seeking 'adventures'.~
@622  = ~Then why are you away from your home?~
@623  = ~Have you ever seen a river flowing into the sea, Kivan? The currents battle and change its course daily, with the tides for centuries uncounted. Then there are embankments wrought by men. They look a sorry thing, forever crumbling, and are in dire need of repair...~
@624  = ~And they are being made, so the embankment stands against the fearsome assault. To carry on with the small reparations is all that the humans can do when faced with the eternal struggles, Kivan.~
@625  = ~Be that the one between the sea and the river, or the one between the Good and the Evil.~
@626  = ~Do you believe that without you, Evil would eventually triumph?~
@627  = ~I am too old to believe in that, Kivan. Yet, I deem it cowardly to resign myself to observing.~
@628  = ~Many in the Order would have me resign or take a position of honor... But I am a workingman, Kivan, and all I can do is labor with my small tools at replacing stones chipped away by the everlasting tide of Evil.~
@629  = ~This urgency to put your whole life to one purpose is a very human thing, I suppose.~
@630  = ~And I suppose that I have heard of an elf who did just the same.~
@631  = ~When your beloved, Deheriana... when she was slain by a foul orc...~
@632  = ~Slain... we elves say "departed", but it is a word for an elf who had willingly left the shores of the Prime Plane to seek out the joys of Arvanaith. Deheriana, indeed, was cut asunder in the very spring of her life. Slain...~
@633  = ~Yes, sometimes cruel things have to be described by cruel words. We cannot beatify the crimes that the malevolent do with passive words that do not call for actions. Yet... May I ask you one thing, Kivan?~
@634  = ~Please, ask your question, Lady Fentan.~
@635  = ~We have vanquished the abomination that has stolen Patrick from me. But my heart still bleeds. How long until the wound closes?~
@636  = ~Revenge is not an ointment that heals. It has been long since I killed Tazok in Baldur's Gate, yet my spirit will be whole again only when I rejoin Deheriana. It is love that heals.~
@637  = ~I wish... I wish that Patrick was Arvoreen's devotee. Alas, he was not, so we are not destined to see each other again.~
@638  = ~Tell me, my good elf, why does your kin love nights so? It is the time when the foulest things are afoot.~
@639  = ~Because it is also the time when the stars shine and one hunts unhindered by heat... The world's face changes in the night. It is almost unrecognizable, but it is no less beautiful after the sunset.~
@640  = ~And the shadows grow long. (Mazzy shudders almost imperceptibly.)~
@641  = ~Your dreadful ordeal must be still fresh in your memory.~
@642  = ~I am not a dainty sort, Kivan, but... what I have seen in this temple was an ultimate allegory of a triumph of evil over good, for the shadow took over the place whence once the light ruled.~
@643  = ~If we have not returned it to the Light, at least we have cleansed it of the Shadow. And you fought fearlessly for it. Anyone who would dare to call you craven is a liar.~
@644  = ~It was... disconcerting, barring even that I was about to serve as a vessel of evil.~
@645  = ~And yet you yielded not an inch to the Shadow Lord, you did not surrender. For me this is the bravery of the highest kind.~
@646  = ~Being forced into evil is abominable, but not nearly as horrifying as choosing to do evil, knowing full well the pain and suffering it should cause others.~
@647  = ~I admire my squire Valygar for his persistence in pursuing evil, even if it plagues his own family. 'Tis good that I took him into my service when I did.~
@648  = ~Mazzy, why are you telling me this?~
@649  = ~I caught a disapproving glance from you another night, elf. It aggravated me that even a man so devoted to goodness as you are have not understood my actions in that matter.~
@650  = ~Valygar is a proud man, Mazzy. I am not the best judge of a human's age, but I saw a thread of silver in his hair. It is a sign of maturity. And you pushed him into a position that is suitable for boys.~
@651  = ~I understand that. But he is not alone in his struggle anymore, and has a more experienced comrade to lead him by example.~
@652  = ~So why won't you be a comrade? A friend, even?~
@653  = ~You have said so - he is a proud man, and his heart is closed. If I do not act quickly, he will devour himself. I have no time to build friendship, therefore I command it. I knew no other way to prevent harm.~
@654  = ~(Kivan shakes his head.) As you wish.~
@655  = ~You remain unconvinced, but you should see that I have done what was right after a time.~
@656  = ~You are quite the bowman, Kivan.~
@657  = ~I was, as they say in Shilmista, born with a bow. My father took me to the Snowflake Mountains to cut my very first white ash for a bow when I was but a child; at least by elven standards.~
@658  = ~It was your father then who taught you the skill?~
@659  = ~Yes, and he taught me well. A long bow is my kin's weapon of choice.~
@660  = ~Aye, I love the sound of the string ringing by my cheek no less than direct onslaught.~
@661  = ~What made you to learn the bow, Mazzy?~
@662  = ~Ipathia the Archer. Her bow-staff is black and inlaid with mother of pearl, and her arrows never miss their target.~
@663  = ~You sound very fond of your tutor, Mazzy.~
@664  = ~It is so, but our connection is more spiritual than real. Ipathia the Archer was a valiant paladin from an old tale.~
@665  = ~Her adventures were many, but her most famous deed occurred when she was young, and could not yet bend a long bow.~
@666  = ~A dragon was attacking Ipathia's village in the Dales, and the Mayor who lead the villagers into the desperate bid to save their livelihoods had been thrown to the ground by the dragon's wing. Ipathia, a slip of a girl, came between the dragon and the fallen man. She had time to loose one arrow while the dragon was turning around for another attack.~
@667  = ~It broke harmlessly on the dragon's armor.~
@668  = ~Even so, Ipathia did not run for cover, instead firing once more. That second arrow blinded the foul beast.~
@669  = ~An inspiring tale, Lady Fentan. Infallibly, those who mount their defenses against the overwhelming foe and hold till the bitter end win my admiration.~
@670  = ~The tales of righteousness and honor always attract those bold and pure of heart, Kivan.~
@671  = ~I only wish that the cost of such bravery in life was not so high.~
@672  = ~Those who halt to ponder the price of bravery will never stand up against the threat of danger. They surrender and beg for treaties when it would be better to fight, for they confuse safety with justice.~
@673  = ~Argh! Friend Kivan! Let Boo give an old comrade a mighty embrace! See how tightly he hugs your thumb, Kivan! Boo missed you!~
@674  = ~I am touched by Boo's welcome, mellonamin.~
@675  = ~Dynaheir would be welcoming you heartily as well, but the evil ones slew Minsc's witch in front of him...~
@676  = ~I mourn Dynaheir's passing. She was a wise, good-hearted woman.~
@677  = ~Yes! Minsc has failed her! Minsc allowed them to kill her! Argh!~
@678  = ~So did I fail to protect the woman I loved more than my own life.~
@679  = ~Friend Kivan, what are we to do, you and I?~
@680  = ~There is a young lady whom the evil wizard imprisoned far away; we still can help rescue her, and you shall avenge your witch.~
@681  = ~Imoen! Yes! We can save Imoen and enact a mighty wizardly butt-kicking! Follow me, little friend, follow me... mel... what is that fruity thing elves call a friend, Boo?~
@682  = ~Aha! Follow me, mellon! Follow me!~
@683  = ~Friend Kivan, Boo thinks that you should go to Rashemen with us, once we have saved little Imoen and kicked the vile butt of the evil wizard!~
@684  = ~Thank you for the invitation, Minsc - and Boo, of course - but I am otherwise engaged after our quest is over.~
@685  = ~Nothing could be more important than returning a smile to your face! Nice Rashemi girls would re-kindle any heart!~
@686  = ~Deheriana is the only woman for me, Minsc.~
@687  = ~Eh... Boo says that Deheriana is... well... dead.~
@688  = ~Perhaps Boo did not encounter elves before, Minsc? Our kind do not die, not truly. We depart to a land far away called Arvanaith...~
@689  = ~Rashemen is a land far away, so Minsc reckons that Deheriana might be in the neighborhood... and it would be wiser to travel together. Minsc and Boo and Kivan!~
@690  = ~Arvanaith is farther away than Rahsemen, Minsc, much farther away.~
@691  = ~That's really far, then. Friend Kivan must hurry, or he never will catch up with his lady friend.~
@692  = ~I am making haste, Minsc, I am making haste...~
@693  = ~Do you still miss your lady friend, Kivan?~
@694  = ~Yes, Minsc, I long for Deheriana.~
@695  = ~Minsc understands that. He misses his witch, too. But what Minsc does not understand is why friend Kivan would not take an animal companion, like Minsc who has Boo!~
@696  = ~Minsc, not all are as lucky as Boo and you. To bond with an animal properly a ranger has to search for many years before encountering a beast that is akin to a particular man of the woods.~
@697  = ~If that is not done, a bond can cause more harm than good.~
@698  = ~How's that? Minsc and Boo have always been great friends!~
@699  = ~A man can enslave an animal and deprive it of its natural freedom to do his bidding. Or a beast can overtake a man's soul...~
@700  = ~Boo says he approves of Kivan being cautious, then.~
@701  = ~Ah, Boo, wait 'til we go back home and get admitted to the Ice Berserker's Lodge! Then you will have a chance to tell the stories of the lands we have seen and our adventures!~
@702  = ~I am sure it will be quite a story.~
@703  = ~Minsc wishes that it had a good ending, with Dynaheir not being really dead. Some stories are like that, right, Boo?~
@704  = ~But some are not. Alas, I think that the "and they lived happily ever after" ending was invented by bards.~
@705  = ~O, no, friend Kivan.  Boo says you are just being melon... lanky...  me-lan-cholic again. Why would bards sing about something that did not happen?~
@706  = ~Kivan... the way you reach for Deheriana, it reminds me... it reminds me of a woman I was helping some time ago.~
@707  = ~Did she lose her beloved?~
@708  = ~Her son.~
@709  = ~She lived in a small village on my father's lands that was assailed by a tribe of orcs. They killed as many as they could loot, and the rest they locked in the Mayor's house and set on fire to torment the de'Arnise soldiers who were trying to recapture the village.~
@710  = ~This woman, she said to me that her son did not fear to die... but he was only afraid that he would not find his mother beyond this life. So she said to him: "Just hold my hand, dear, and we will not lose each other."~
@711  = ~My father's soldiers managed to chase the orcs away and put the fires down, but half of the villagers died to the smoke or the flames. The woman's little son was among them...~
@712  = ~She... she tried to drown herself as soon as she realized that her child was gone... because... because of her promise, and her hope that she still could catch up to him and enter Ilmater's fold with him.~
@713  = ~And yet she lived?~
@714  = ~Yes, she did. Someone saw her and raised an alarm; they saved her... her body at least. She never tried to kill herself again, because, I think, she'd lost hope of ever finding her son in the afterlife.~
@715  = ~This is my worst fear, Nalia. To lose Deheriana entirely; to have the faint bond that remains taken away from me.~
@716  = ~At first I thought that I was bound by Sheverash to the Material Plane, and I rebelled against what I perceived as his will.~
@717  = ~Did you try to kill yourself?!~
@718  = ~We elves cannot do that... we cannot take our own life, because we are connected to our entire kin's spirit. One cannot sever the bond abruptly without denying himself Arvanaith.~
@719  = ~And if I cannot find Deheriana, what use is death?~
@720  = ~No, I have done what that woman did - I let go of thoughts, I let go of duties, I let go of wants... I dissolved into the world. I was nothing until I heard Shevarash's voice. Only then did I put myself back together, piece by piece.~
@721  = ~I do not know what to say, except that I think Shevarash is a cruel deity.~
@722  = ~Thousands of years ago, Shevarash endured a loss similar to mine - his entire family was slain by drow. Perhaps he saw quality in me that would not allow me to rest in Arvanaith until I had slain Deheriana's murderers. Just like he could not find peace.~
@723  = ~Or, perhaps, I have uttered a vow that bound me to him amidst my tortures.~
@724  = ~After all this time, I finally understand that what I have done was no one's choice but my own.~
@725  = ~I have heard tales about men like you -~
@726  = ~My lady de'Arnise, I doubt that I am bard's tale material.~
@727  = ~Tales... they are all different, but I think that the characters are often similar. There are always valiant heroes in them, and orphans, charming rogues and fair maidens -~
@728  = ~Then it is rather I who have heard tales of you, than vice versa; for I am neither a rogue, nor orphan, nor indeed a hero.  And I would never dare to claim the role of a fair maiden, for it is rightfully yours, my Lady de'Arnise.  <CHARNAME>, perhaps -~
@729  = ~But there is also a wanderer... a noble stranger who had lost everything, and now walks alone, helping those who are in need.~
@730  = ~Your perception of me is hardly... realistic.~
@731  = ~Yes, my good elf, I agree.  What I was going to say is that like almost everything that I encounter in my travels with <CHARNAME>, meeting you makes me question the tales.~
@732  = ~You see, it was my favorite type of character, and I dreamed to be just like that one day, destitute, proud and benevolent. Yet...~
@733  = ~Yet?~
@734  = ~It is rather dull.~
@735  = ~O, but this is nothing that a slew of admirers taking in every word of your 'adventures in the slums' cannot fix, is not it?~
@736  = ~I am not that shallow, elf.  I did not abandon my station to impress the empty-headed fools that have little care for anything but their titles and estates. I ventured into the world hoping to meet better and nobler people and to make a difference. But I do not see how those heroes in the stories managed to do so much, if they were like you. You almost never speak, you hide your face, and while you fight with rare bravery, you do not seek out vile oppressors to destroy them, except for Tazok, if <CHARNAME> is to be believed.~
@737  = ~Nalia, perhaps trying to be less of a wanderer and more of a charming rogue is something that will suit your aspirations better.~
@738  = ~That's what I think, too.~
@739  = ~Oh, Shevarash, give me strength to go on and fulfill your bidding.~
@740  = ~What kindness did Shevarash do to you that you champion him?~
@741  = ~He offered me a chance to avenge my beloved.~
@742  = ~A false gift the way I see it, Kivan. <CHARNAME> says you were all but possessed by your chase.~
@743  = ~Are you any less absorbed in your quest to destroy Lavok?~
@744  = ~I do it of my own volition, not to satisfy a god.~
@745  = ~Kivan, your life was full of hardship and pain because you loved a woman. Tell me, was it worth it?~
@746  = ~Yes, Valygar.~
@747  = ~Bah, why I am even asking. I know that my choice is right. The curse is strong in my line, and if I were to love a woman, I would have only doomed her or our children.~
@748  = ~To doom someone you love, you do not need to be a cursed man. If I had been more cautious, Deheriana would be alive today.~
@749  = ~No, unless you are Alaundo the Seer, you cannot foretell where lightning will strike. Even if you are Alaundo, you first have to decipher your own dim words. For me it is as clear as the Nine Hells are hot: whoever binds herself to me will regret the day she cast her eyes on me.~
@750  = ~Women...~
@751  = ~Why did you leave Shilmista in the first place?~
@752  = ~The world beckoned me. I wished to see Myth Drannor and Deheriana dancing in the streets of the City of Beauty.~
@753  = ~Why?~
@754  = ~Because I loved her, and we needed hope. Shilmista was scorched in the war with the Castle Trinity and had nigh disappeared.~
@755  = ~But Myth Drannor was destroyed long before Shilmista! What hope could you find among the ruins? One is more likely to despair, if you ask me.~
@756  = ~The hope that generations after we are gone, our descendants would honor us and our battles and bow their heads in our memory.~
@757  = ~Descendents are strange beasts. They will judge us from the pedestal of their knowledge, forgetting that we had to act on but a shred of it.~
@758  = ~Is that why you want your line to fail with you? Because you are afraid to be judged in the same harsh way that you have judged your ancestors?~
@759  = ~No, elf. You know full well that I do it because I have to stop the curse that my bloodline carries!~
@760  = ~The forests around here are beautiful. There are species of both plants and beasts here that I have either never seen or that have minute differences from what I have seen in the foothills of the Snowflake Mountains.~
@761  = ~You have not ventured this far south before, elf?~
@762  = ~No, human. After... after Deheriana died, I simply went where Tazok went. Prior to that I kept to the north. Some countries to the south and east are rumored to disfavor my kin. Tethyr is one. I had no desire for us to be insulted for the length of our ears and the cut of our eyes.~
@763  = ~I understand you all too well. I'm a human, all right, and none doubts it, but whenever my name comes up, I can see in their eyes what they are thinking.~
@764  = ~An insane necromancer...~
@765  = ~You do not look like a wizard, Valygar, nor like a madman.~
@766  = ~You're telling me! My whole life I tried to avoid becoming just that! And what is my reward?!~
@767  = ~That you have succeeded.~
@768  = ~So darthirii, it seems we meet again.  I trust you will try to act more civilized this time?~
@769  = ~I had hoped to never lay eyes on your foul form again, drow.  But with what life has already thrown at me, I should have known I would be disappointed.~
@770  = ~So you still obsess over that woman of yours...~
@771  = ~That "woman" has a name! Deheriana! Although I never want to hear it out of your vile mouth!~
@772  = ~Then I shall just go on calling her "that woman".~
@773  = ~Enough! You have had your fun... now leave me be!~
@774  = ~This world is cursed! The burning sun, the deafening bird-noises, the stifling pollen. Feh.~
@775  = ~Then crawl back into the hole from whence you came.~
@776  = ~Ignorant rivvin, I would return, should I gain an army to take Menzoberranzan from Baenre's clutches. I would destroy the highest Houses to elevate DeVir and to make myself the First Matron, if I could.~
@777  = ~Despite your professed hatred for the traitorous Lolth?~
@778  = ~Not all drow worship the Spider Queen, darthiir, and Shar's favor is more lucrative. But my nation is fierce, and only a madman would live alone in the Underdark.~
@779  = ~You must have done that after you fled.~
@780  = ~Of course I did. I am strong, but I did not ascend to this blighted place out of my own volition.~
@781  = ~You acknowledge your defeat so easily, Viconia, while calling everyone else weak at a smallest hint of wavering?~
@782  = ~Feh, I'm not a stupid surfacer to persist in folly. The smart one lives, the stupid dies, that's the truth.~
@783  = ~Every time I look at you, you tighten. Were we in Menzoberranzan, I'd give you a good flogging, so you'd prostrate yourself instead.~
@784  = ~...~
@785  = ~But ripping out your tongue would not be necessary. Not that it is common, mind you. Hearing them wail and beg is part of the fun.~
@786  = ~Should I heal you, darthiir, or would you rather die of your wounds as a favour to us all?~
@787  = ~Death is gentler than your healing.~
@788  = ~Death is gentler than most things, pathetic fool. I take that as a no... very well, I will await for our leader's command to force the spell upon you.~
@789  = ~Maybe this time I would hear you scream.~
@790  = ~Still breathing? How disappointing. It is unbearable to be in a party with a darthiir...~
@791  = ~The only thing that makes it unbearable is your foul mouth, witch. If all drow are like you, I cannot comprehend how you can live in communities. It is not surprising that even some of your kind are fed up with the vileness of your ways. I wonder how long it will take before the best of your kind will gather enough strength to rebel against the Spider Queen.~
@792  = ~That is a false hope, rivvin. Lolth is a cunning mistress and watches her rothe herd carefully. The high priestesses are ever restless, hunting the outlaws to sacrifice to Lolth and gain her favor.~
@793  = ~Drizzt is famous for his escape... and you have mentioned that your brother was a deviant, as well. That's three renegade Drow in a short period of time.~
@794  = ~I know none, save myself. Drizzt brought misfortune and ill fate to all of Menzoberranzan. Gah! I doubt that anyone would feel anything but loathing for him. Drizzt's treachery strengthened my people's resolve to keep to their own ways.~
@795  = ~I know your people's ways. I have seen babes and women slain without pity by their sharp blades! How can a being that presumably has a heart commit deeds of such cruelty?~
@796  = ~If you wish for me to answer for all of my kin's doings, you are too late. You should have thrown a torch into my pyre.~
@797  = ~I've heard them call you a 'wise man'. Feh, a wise man! This is a contradiction in terms.~
@798  = ~Do you maintain that wisdom is the province of women, and that you possess this virtue?~
@799  = ~You dare questioning me, feeble darthiir?~
@800  = ~Then explain how it is wise to poison your company against you.~
@801  = ~I would not mock an equal or a superior, rivvin.~
@802  = ~But you would hound those you consider beneath you. A battle party is only as good as its weakest companion.~
@803  = ~If the commander <PRO_HIMHER>self is a senseless whiner who recruits and coddles the weaklings, driving them away falls to those who are truly the strongest.~
@804  = ~So, you call arrogance wisdom. I thought so.~

@812  = ~We have a certain similarity, Kivan. I used to have a sister - a fair bloom on the youngest of the branches. And then she was torn away by the cruel wind. Snapped. Just like that.~
@813  = ~So often do I say "I mourn with you" that it frightens me.~
@814  = ~Too true. The world has become a wicked place.~
@815  = ~How do you find food here, elf?~
@816  = ~I hunt for my food or buy it at inns.~
@817  = ~Did I hear it right? A joke from our grim ally?~
@818  = ~Yoshimo, I rarely pay much attention to my sustenance.~
@819  = ~I have forgotten that you made it a point to shun even the most innocent of enjoyments, such as food and drink. What of other foreign customs? It must be a challenge for an elf to stay among humans for so long.~
@820  = ~I was fortunate not to encounter outright hostility toward elves. I have found some things that humans do quite peculiar, but that is the extent of it.~
@821  = ~Too true. I, myself, am fascinated with how western ways are sometimes similar and sometimes so entirely different from ours.~
@822  = ~One of the most bothersome habits which I am now convinced is native to all humans, westerlings or easterlings, is making small talk.~
@823  = ~You would not say!~
@824  = ~How many elves could dance on the head of a pin, Kivan?~
@825  = ~None, I presume.~
@826  = ~No, all of them, for they are one with the world and connected to one another.~
@827  = ~Still "none", for then Elvendom is a part of a pin, as well, and cannot be separated from it.~
@828  = ~That is, if Elvendom and the pin are both substances. Perhaps the essence of the Elvendom is to be put on the end of a pin, in which case the whole of Elvendom is reaching toward being placed on the top of a pin, just did not quite get there yet.~
@829  = ~Perhaps you can show the way.~
@830  = ~You'd want me to dance on the head of a pin?~
@831  = ~Hey! Elf! Ye be flailin' yer bow like a bard takin' a fit on his harp.~
@832  = ~Indeed. My heart is in my battles.~
@833  = ~Pfeh! Ye keeps yer heart so far out of battle, 'tis a wonder ye ever see one clear but that was not me point.~
@834  = ~I have no bloodlust, dwarf. I do what must be done to protect the living and to avenge the fallen. I don't do it for the twisted pleasure of wallowing in bloody meat that you profess.~
@835  = ~Nay! Bones of chalk and blood of daisy-syrup. I've split enough of yer kind t'know that. But for all yer knit ones and purl twos, it takes ye an hour to pink one worthwhile enemy. More, if he's wearin' a hard coat over him.~
@836  = ~So? You are so able a warrior that you never require ranged support?~
@837  = ~Pfeh! I know me battle tactics, numbpate. Better'n ye knows yer blasted nuts and berries. But while yer haverin' back yonder, couldn't ye just sing 'em a fireball lullaby or two? The sort of thing that culls the weak and lets a *man* concentrate on other men?~
@838  = ~If I could, I would. But I have not the gift of thaumaturgy.~
@839  = ~I knew it! Ye bleats on 'bout yer love-lorn vengeance but haven't brain nor heart to learn nothin' useful t' the purpose of it.~
@840  = ~I pity you, Korgan. You know little of loss and nothing of love, and yet you claim to know my heart. I tell you more: I would be scared, if you in truth understood me.~
@841  = ~Phht! Ye'd be 'truly scared' of somethin' if ye never seen nor heard of me. It's just the way of ye gizzardless lollopers.~
@842  = ~I indeed tried to love you in a fashion that a wife should love her husband, but I am unable to order my heart. It has been given by fate to someone who neither needs it, nor suspects my plight. I will not have you suffer the role of the second best, Anomen. (You steal a quick glance at Kivan.)~
