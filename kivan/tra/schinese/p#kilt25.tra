@301  = ~Things about myself. It's important, Kivan. Please, do not interfere.~
@302  = ~Alas, I cannot avoid it, wherever it is leading me. My heritage is dark, and my destiny is twisted. Those creatures, they hold answers.~
@303  = ~Yes, you are.~
@304  = ~(The rivers froth with blood, murders are committed in your wake, and the war ravages your homeland and beyond. Many, so many hate you. Yet, amidst the horror and madness, there is also love. Your Kivan never fails to remind you of this.)~
@305  = ~(His fingers brush your cheek, lightly, tenderly. They push a lock of hair out of your eyes and smother something - a tear? blood?- away.)~
@306  = ~When I look at you, <CHARNAME>, I am lost for words.~
@307  = ~Then look at me in silence.~
@308  = ~Truly? I must be hearing things, then.~
@309  = ~Its no good for you to swallow your tongue. Do manage to say *something* pleasant!~
@310  = ~(He leans over quickly and kisses you, barely touching your lips with his.)~
@311  = ~I like... looking.~
@312  = ~(Kivan presses his finger across his lips, and eats you with his eyes for half-a-heartbeat.)~
@313  = ~(shakes his head) Anything will be too meager...~
@314  = ~(A dreamy smile dances across his lips. Is he thinking about you?)~
@315  = ~(You look towards Kivan, and your eyes meet his.)~
@316  = ~Were you watching me?~
@317  = ~(Wave at him.)~
@318  = ~(Turn away slowly.)~
@319  = ~(Drop your eyes, blushing.)~
@320  = ~(Stretch slowly, showing every inch of your figure to him in the most favorable way possible.)~
@321  = ~I was. I cannot keep my eyes off of you for long.~
@322  = ~(Kivan pulls a hunting glove off and lifts his hand, palm facing you.)~
@323  = ~(Do the same, and walk towards Kivan.)~
@324  = ~(Do the same, but remain where you are.)~
@325  = ~(Watch him.)~
@326  = ~(You meet each-other, palm on palm, and continue moving, 'til brow is on brow and then, finally, lips are on lips...)~
@327  = ~(Kivan lifts his other hand and makes a reaching gesture, as if there is a precipice that separates you.)~
@328  = ~(Do the same.)~
@329  = ~(Run towards him, breathless, and leap into his arms.)~
@330  = ~(He hugs you tightly and rains kisses on you.)~
@331  = ~(His hands drop down to his sides, and his angular features become the very image of despair and longing.)~
@332  = ~(You notice that Kivans dark eyes, bright and delighted, follow your every move.)~
@333  = ~(You hear a soft laugh. It sounds both amused and pleased.)~
@334  = ~(Kivan quickly crosses the distance that separates you, but stops short. He crosses his arms across his chest and watches your every move. It seems that he breathes harder than usual.)~
@335  = ~(Kivan lifts you off the ground into his arms and whirls you around until the world becomes a colorful kaleidoscope.)~
@336  = ~(Kivan cups your chin, lifts your face towards him and kisses you gently on the tip of your nose, and then, as you close your eyes, on your eyelids.)~
@337  = ~(Kivan looks at you for a long moment, and then whispers.) What can I compare you to? The stars? The flowers? The wind?~
@338  = ~Do I need to compare you to anything? You are you, and nothing in the world has your quality.~
@339  = ~(Kivan takes your face between his palms.) A heroine of how many tales, and none but I know the true you... or so I hope.~
@340  = ~(He blows at your eyelashes slightly.) Ah, amael, we are in the eye of the storm. So much turmoil is building up around us, and here I am, watching your eyelashes tremble with my breath, a soft smile on your lips.~
@341  = ~Wait, oh wait, fleet-footed. So swift you are that I picture you sometimes with wings. Multicolored wings of a butterfly, or the pure-white of a swan, or the wings of fire and shadows...~
@342  = ~You have quite an imagination.~
@343  = ~(Laugh.)~
@344  = ~Or the leathery ones of a dragon or a demon! Do I scare you, my love?~
@345  = ~If I were a butterfly or a pixie, I would have alighted on your wrist...~
@346  = ~Amael, around you, who needs imagination? You are beyond belief.~
@347  = ~(reddens) I am an idiot.~
@348  = ~Mmgh... Yes, at times. Amael, you can turn into Bhaals avatar, the Slayer, at will. Only a madman could face you without fear then. But I love you.~
@349  = ~And I would have brought you up to my face, shielded you from the gusts of wind that would have threatened to carry you off, and asked you not to fly away.~
@350  = ~You know what I was just thinking about? That I am happy. For the first time in so many years, I am happy.~
@351  = ~(Kivan walks by your side for a few moments, and then takes your hand. He does not squeeze or kiss it; he just holds it, as he casually strolls by your side.)~
@352  = ~(A warm feeling, that. Simple. Beautiful.)~
@353  = ~(Kivan leans over to you and whispers in your ear.) ~
@354  = ~Kiss me, amael.~
@355  = ~(Take his hand, lift it to your lips and kiss his fingers.) For your suffering.~
@356  = ~(You stop, thread your fingers though his hair, and lean his head towards you. Then you plant a hard, demanding kiss on his lips.)~
@357  = ~(Peck him on the cheek.)~
@358  = ~(He brushes your lips, and then leans to kiss them wordlessly.)~
@359  = ~(His arms close around your waist and he pulls you up into the air, making the kiss last for a long, long time.)~
@360  = ~(Kivan ruffles your hair fondly.) Woodpecker.~
@361  = ~(Kivan gives you an attentive glance, then walks over and adjusts the hood of your cloak, though it does not need adjusting.  Then he pulls it forward and kisses you, using the sides of the cowl to screen you two from the prying eyes.)~
@362  = ~(Kivan runs his hand through his hair, letting it fall loose to his shoulders and laughs quietly.) Joy, <CHARNAME>, is a state of well-being and the source of delight. Joy, <CHARNAME>, is you.~
@363  = ~I made a crown of leaves for you. The oaken leaves, because you are strong and do not yield to your enemies. The birch leaves, because you are gentle and understanding. The poplar leaves, because you are proud and tall. The maple leaves, because you are so beautiful... And the linden leaf, shaped as a heart, to tell you that the one who made the wreath loves you.~
@364  = ~You look sad, amael. Are you well?~
@365  = ~Yes... It was just a spell... It will pass.~
@366  = ~Oh, Kivan, if you only could imagine how difficult it is for me to hold onto sanity and...~
@367  = ~(Turn your sad eyes up at him.)~
@368  = ~I am not sad at all!~
@369  = ~Here, to speed the heartsickness on its way... (He kisses your palm.)~
@370  = ~(He holds you, stroking your hair.) I cannot know a tithe of what you are going through, but if I can be of help, any help at all, do call on me, <CHARNAME>. Please, do call on me.~
@371  = ~I can drown in the sorrowful depths of your eyes. I... I wish I could chase the gloom away, and make them sparkle with laughter.~
@372  = ~(Kivan shields his eyes and gives you a long, probing glance.) It is true. My worry for you must have fooled me.~
@373  = ~(As you walk past Kivan, he follows you for a few steps, his arms wrapped around your shoulders, and his lips pressed against the top of your head.)~
@374  = ~(Kivans deft fingers separate a lock of your hair. He pulls it out gently and tickles his nose with it.) The way your hair smells make me think about carnations and honey.~
@375  = ~(Kivan tucks a large white flower behind your ear. It suits you, is all he says by the way of explanation.)~
@376  = ~Sometimes I think that nobody deserves rest after the day's trials as much as you do, <CHARNAME>.~
@377  = ~(With a small smile, Kivan empties a gem bag and touches your shoulder, staying you from sitting up. Picking up jewel after jewel with his deft fingers, he sets them on your forehead, neck and chest in a pattern. Finally, he leans back to survey the results of his labors. And sweeps the multicolored array back into the bag.)~
@378  = ~You are the most precious jewel of all.~
@379  = ~(Barefoot, his hair tied back, Kivan bends over yet another thing that needs mending, but his eyes are on you more often than on his even, tight stitches. He throws another glance your way, and curses softly at a pricked thumb. He bites off the thread and the clothes rolled in a loose ball are sent flying by his strong arm.)~
@380  = ~This will keep till tomorrow.~
@381  = ~(Flicker. Flicker. The flame of the candle dances, shielded by his scarred hand. The shadows cast by his angular features are sharp, but there is nothing hard about his eyes set on you. His eyes are black flame.)~
@382  = ~(Wearily, Kivan sits down by your feet. He leans back against your ankles, and rests his head in your lap. His eyes are closed, the dark eyelashes a semicircle above the high cheekbones. He sighs contentedly, as if the world is at peace.)~
@383  = ~(Kivan kneels in front of you and embraces your knees. He presses his forehead, and then his cheek against your thigh.)~
@384  = ~Sometimes, a'mael, I think that I would have been lost, if it was not for you.~
@385  = ~(Kivan gently pushes hair away from your face. He washes the day's dust and memory away, wielding a hot towel soaked in steaming water, scented in elven fashion with lavender and some other herb, bitter and fresh. After discarding the cloth in a silver basin, his elegant fingers tarry, drawing complicated patterns at your temples and cheeks.)~
@386  = ~There are nights so dark, with no stars, nor moon, nor city lights that even an elf walks nigh blindly. But it can never be so dark that I cannot see you. I need only close my eyes...~
@387  = ~(Measured, regular motions send the dagger sliding against the honing stone. A mercenary, taking care of his weapons... until, having touched the blade on the thumb and found it to his satisfaction, Kivan draws the point through a pomegranates skin. He breaks the fruit in two, blood-red juice running down his fingers.)~
@388  = ~(He collects the ruby grains, and offers them to you off his palm.)~
@389  = ~(Suck the juice off Kivan's fingers.)~
@390  = ~(Give Kivan's hand a little push sending the seeds flying.)~
@391  = ~(Pick the grains with your lips kissing his palm.)~
@392  = ~(Taking a seed between thumb and forefinger, make a move as to feed it to Kivan.)~
@393  = ~They look like the drops of blood that surround the skull on my sire's sigil.~
@394  = ~(Kivan smiles, and puts the next piece of fruit between his lips, inviting you to take it in the same manner.)~
@395  = ~All that work for nothing...~
@396  = ~(His palm trembles under your lips, as the fingers of his free hand caress your neck, and run a cautious foray into your hair.)~
@397  = ~(Kivan's lips close around your fingers, and his tongue, having dislodged the fruit, endeavors to tickle the tips of the captured digits.)~
@398  = ~I... Next time I will find a peach.~
@399  = ~(Kivan takes your hand and strokes your fingers, then twines them with his, touching them to his face. The cool tips seemingly have a calming, healing effect when they stroke his hot, almost feverish brow. You have a vision of raindrops landing onto the burning-hot rocks of the desert.)~
@400  = ~(Kivan opens your palm and kisses it. He closes your fingers into a fist, and starts unfolding them one by one.)~
@401  = ~First goes your thumb, and I shall call it aiatar - little father.~
@402  = ~Then goes your index finger, and I will call it beleger - the mighty one, because they say that you have but to point at something with it, and it is yours.~
@403  = ~Then goes your middle finger, and I will call it hallaer - the tall one, by the obvious reasons.~
@404  = ~Then goes your ring finger, and I will call it voronwer - the loyal one, because a ring is often a promise.~
@405  = ~And the pinky, the nessaer, the young one.~
@406  = ~Can you hear the dreams that hide in shadows? I thought so. Go to sleep, a'mael, and I will keep watch and make sure that the blood dreams do not pounce on you.~
@407  = ~I was watching you dream, a'mael
And I was not asleep myself
For the day job is never done
For one silly but loyal elf...~
@408  = ~I am happy to while my time
By your side, when the others rest
For my job is to love your nights
For my job is to love your days.~
@409  = ~Ten thousand years ago, long before the Crown Wars, Fenalarel wrote that the eyes of his lover were the brightest stars, magnificent and proud. The compliment was old even then. But when I look into your eyes, I think of the stars, and it does not matter to me that thousands upon thousands of men gasped with the same awe and admiration over the millennia. May Araleth Letheranil, the Prince of Stars and the Twilight Rider, forgive me my trespass.~
@410  = ~There are shadowy glades in the Snowflake Mountains, amael. And the secretive turquoise lakes nest there, high on the slopes, close to the sky. They mirror stars by night, and sun by day, but they are always cold and crystal clean. Those are the most beautiful places I know in the world. I wonder if I will ever guide you to this country of the shining lakes?~
@411  = ~(Kivan unbinds his hair and threads his hand through it, slowly. Curly strands cascade past his shoulders, across his eyes, and he keeps mussing the dark mass, until he pushes it back with a few lazy strokes. Then he sits motionless, but his face is not without expression. His eyes simply look on something that none else can see; he is hardly conscious of what he is doing, and you cannot guess his thoughts.)~
@412  = ~(Kivan moves his finger past your eyelashes, and then touches it to your lips.) Alasseamin, at times I wonder how there could be so much gentleness in someone who has been through enough trials to change feathers into steel.~
@413  = ~(Kivan sits by you, his legs crossed under him, and peers up into your face. Then he closes his eyes, as if trying to remember something. Finally, in a low voice, almost under his breath, he recites.)~
@414  = ~You step out of mist and myth
To walk into battles and trouble
There are tales untold in your kiss
And a song to be left unsung...~
@415  = ~(He is no good at it at all. His voice, while not unpleasant, does not quiver with the sonorous strength of a bards. But, somehow, it is endearing that he tries.)~
@416  = ~(Kivan wakes up from a short reverie with a start and turns amazed, widened eyes upon you.)~
@417  = ~I dreamt of you. You were walking through ash and spring flowers sprouted from char wherever your bare foot stepped. You... you were crossing my heart.~
@418  = ~You look concerned, amael. Here, let me try to reduce the tension that the dark thoughts bring.~
@419  = ~(Kivan caresses and massages your shoulders, the base of your neck and then your skull, letting your hair thread between his fingers. Having finished, he kisses the top of your head and your brow.)~
@420  = ~Shoo! Fly away, crows, fly away.~
@421  = ~At the dawn of time, in the high halls, there walked a prince of the elves. His lute was strummed with silverstrings, and he was said to write the first and the last eversong since my kin traveled to Faerun from the distant stars...~
@422  = ~But I am hopeless! Come here, amael, let me kiss you. Yours is the brightest song of them all.~
@423  = ~It is said that Nymwael was so loved by Rillifane Rallathil that the Leaflord whispered to the butterflies, and ever since they chose the brightest of their number to escort the gentlest of all elves, and flew around her wherever she walked, making a multicolored veil. I would have liked to see you adorned that way. But it must have tickled...~
@424  = ~We are finally alone, Kivan, and you want to... talk? Again?~
@425  = ~Kivan... I want it... us... something special...~
@426  = ~Words <CHARNAME>, I will hold you, and shelter you, and give myself to you; and in doing so, perhaps, I can convey just how truly and deeply I love you.~
@427  = ~No.~
@428  = ~I should have guessed. Kivan, I love you, but I just don't want you to plunge into it like that. Let's take it slow, there is less chance for both of us to get hurt that way.~
@429  = ~Kivan, what comfort and passion I have to offer a man, I yearn to give you. I've not loved anyone like that.~
@430  = ~Let's brush up on it then, though something tells me that you won't be all that rusty.~
@431  = ~I have not undressed a woman and carried her to my bedroll for many a year, <CHARNAME>.~
@432  = ~Well, if we are both so unsure, it's better to wait till we are in control of our impulses.~
@433  = ~You have not been with anyone since Deheriana?~
@434  = ~Kivan, what comfort and passion I have to offer a man, I yearn to give you. I've not loved anyone like that.~
@435  = ~Let's brush up on it then, though something tells me that you won't be all that rusty.~
@436  = ~Just say a simple 'yes' or 'no', amael. Please. I am nervous too.~
@437  = ~Y-yes...~
@438  = ~No. Not tonight.~
@439  = ~Why why are you nervous? ~
@440  = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. Go to sleep now, and dream of light.~
@441  = ~I am afraid to offend.~
@442  = ~How do you go about telling a woman that you can barely think when she is so close? I guess that's how.~
@443  = ~You are not going to lose me. Yes, I want to know you as a woman. No, that is not where my need for you begins and ends. Sleep on it, alcarinque.~
@444  = ~I am glad to know that. It it reassures me.~
@445  = ~Aren't you going to even try to... seduce me?~
@446  = ~I'm just not ready, yet. I'm sorry.~
@447  = ~Why are you shying away from words? If you do not want to make love to me, I will go.~
@448  = ~I... I don't want to lose you.~
@449  = ~How do you go about telling a man that your knees weaken with desire every time you catch a sight of him? I guess that's how.~
@450  = ~Aren't you going to even try to... seduce me?~
@451  = ~I'm just not ready, yet. I'm sorry.~
@452  = ~M-making love to... to you? Ah... I... Oh...~
@453  = ~No, I do not want to talk. I want to -~
